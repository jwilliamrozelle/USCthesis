	abstract = {Little research exists that examines the causal relationship between patient satisfaction and the use of health services. This study of a representative sample of low income families suggests that a relationship does exist. Furthermore, results reported indicate it is bidirectional and reciprocal in nature, and that it is highly related to the provider from which patients seek care. Analysis according to the five major area clinics that were main sources of medical care for an upstate New York community (two HMOs, two hospital-affiliated teaching clinics, and one continuity-of-care clinic) revealed that, in some providers, the association between use and satisfaction is positive, in others negative. Further evidence for a "patient provider" interaction hypothesis was found, suggesting that background characteristics, including health status and race, are related to use and satisfaction in different ways in different clinics. The findings provide evidence for the existence of a causal relationship between use and satisfaction, which is dependent on the context in which medical care is given, and also suggest structural characteristics that might be responsible for these effects. A final conceptual model of satisfaction is offered, permitting reciprocal causation with use and satisfaction with emphasis on patient provider interactions, and this model provides an identification of short- and long-term processes. Progress in this area might require a shift in perspective upward toward structural and systems variables or a shift downward toward "microanalytic" processes, which detail patient-provider interactions.},

However, the relationship between patient satisfaction and health care utilization, expenditures, and outcomes remains ill defined.We conducted a prospective cohort study of adult respondents (N = 51 946) to the 2000 through 2007 national Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, including 2 years of panel data for each patient and mortality follow-up data through December 31, 2006, for the 2000 through 2005 subsample (n = 36 428).

	abstract = {Despite spending more than any other nation on medical care per person, the United States ranks behind other industrialized nations in key health performance measures. A main cause is the deep disparities in access to care and health outcomes. Federal programs such as the designations of Medically Underserved Areas/Populations and Health Professional Shortage Areas are designed to boost the number of health professionals serving these areas and to help alleviate the access problem. Their effectiveness relies first and foremost on an accurate measure of accessibility so that resources can be allocated to truly needy areas. Various measures of accessibility need to be integrated into one framework for comparison and evaluation. Optimization methods can be used to improve the distribution and supply of health care providers to maximize service coverage, minimize travel needs of patients, limit the number of facilities, and maximize health or access equality. Inequality in health care access comes at a personal and societal price, evidenced in disparities in health outcomes, including late-stage cancer diagnosis. This review surveys recent literature on the three named issues with emphasis on methodological advancements and implications for public policy.},

	abstract = {Background: Geographic weights are vital in the floating catchment area (FCA) method of accessibility measurements due to their simulation of spatial barriers in various ways. When modelling population demand, geographical weights with different distance decay coefficients can reflect diverse distance tolerances in facility utilization and could lead to erratic accessibility results. Quantifying accessibility as the sum of weighted supply-demand ratios can alleviate the distance decay coefficient's influence and generate stable geographic patterns. However, the effects of weighted ratios on different FCA models and resources have not been investigated., 
Methods: To identify impacts of weighted ratios on various FCA variants, this study contrasted the accessibility calculated from the sum of ratios (access) and the sum of weighted ratios (access ratios) within three prevalent FCA models: enhanced two-step FCA (E2SFCA), modified two-step FCA (M2SFCA), and three-step FCA (3SFCA). In addition, the accessibilities of various resources evaluate the stability of the weighted ratios' effect. This study therefore examined the accessibilities to primary schools, job opportunities, and major hospitals in Shanghai. Shanghai is a case study that provides lessons on using big data to measure accessibility in metropolitan areas., 
Results: Geographic weights can not only mitigate the impact of the distance decay coefficients, but can also eliminate model features, which reduces the performance of the M2SFCA's supply decay and the 3SFCA's population demand adjustment in accessibility results. Moreover, weighted ratios tend to overestimate accessibility in marginal communities that lie within fewer catchments, regardless of the resource type. This tendency can lead to an epistemological trap that creates an inaccurate and counter-intuitive perception of resource distribution in a given area., 
Conclusions: The results identify a gap between the methodological logic and the empirical perception in accessibility measurements. This study concludes that the use of geographic weights needs to be cautious and epistemologically consistent.},

It has long been recognized that access to SRH services is essential to positive health outcomes, especially in rural areas of developing countries, where long distances as well as poor transportation conditions, can be potential barriers to health care acquisition. Improving accessibility of health services for target populations is therefore critical for specialized healthcare programs. Thus, understanding and evaluation of current access to health care is crucial. Combining spatial information using geographical information system (GIS) with population survey data, this study details a gravity model-based method to measure and evaluate access to SRH services in rural Mozambique, and analyzes potential geographic access to such services, using family planning as an example. Access is found to be a significant factor in reported behavior, superior to traditional distance-based indicators. Spatial disparities in geographic access among different population groups also appear to exist, likely affecting overall program success.},

However, despite notable progress, there remains a large gap between what individuals and communities need, and the quality and effectiveness of care delivered. The Primary Health Care Performance Initiative (PHCPI) was established by an international consortium to catalyze improvements in PHC delivery and outcomes in low- and middle-income countries through better measurement and sharing of effective models and practices. PHCPI has developed a framework to illustrate the relationship between key financing, workforce, and supply inputs, and core primary health care functions of first-contact accessibility, comprehensiveness, coordination, continuity, and person-centeredness. The framework provides guidance for more effective assessment of current strengths and gaps in PHC delivery through a core set of 25 key indicators (“Vital Signs”). Emerging best practices that foster high-performing PHC system development are being codified and shared around low- and high-income countries. These measurement and improvement approaches provide countries and implementers with tools to assess the current state of their PHC delivery system and to identify where cross-country learning can accelerate improvements in PHC quality and effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Objective
To develop a composite measure of primary care quality and apply it to Haiti’s primary care system.

Methods
Using the Primary Health Care Performance Initiative’s framework, we defined four domains of primary care service delivery: (i) accessible care; (ii) effective service delivery; (iii) management and organization; and (iv) primary care functions. We gave each primary care facility in Haiti a quality score for each domain and overall, with poor, fair and good quality indicated by scores of 0.00–0.49, 0.50–0.74 and 0.75–1.00, respectively. We quantified access and effective access to primary care as the proportions of the population within 5 km of any primary care facility and a good facility, respectively.

Findings
Of the 786 primary care facilities in Haiti in 2013, only 332 (43\%) facilities were classified as good for accessible care. Fewer facilities were classified as good in the domains of effective service delivery (30; 4\%), management and organization (91; 12\%) and primary care functions (43; 5\%). Although about 91\% of the population lived within 5 km of a primary care facility, only an estimated 23\% of the entire population – including just 5\% of the rural population – had access to primary care of good quality.

Conclusion
Despite an extensive network of health facilities, a minority of Haitians had access to a primary care facility of good quality. Such facilities were especially scarce in rural areas. Similar systematic analyses of the quality of primary care could inform national efforts to strengthen health systems.},

This research aimed to compare definitions of care quality across research articles that incorporate data from Service Provision Assessment (SPA) surveys. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines, we used a keyword search in PubMed. Each author reviewed abstracts, then full texts, for inclusion criteria, and peer-reviewed publications of empirical analysis using SPA data. The search yielded 3,250 unique abstracts, and 34 publications were included in the final analysis. We extracted details on the SPA dataset(s) used, theoretical framework applied, and how care quality was operationalized. The 34 included articles used SPA data from 14 surveys in nine countries (all in sub-Saharan Africa plus Haiti). One-third of these articles (n = 13) included no theoretical or conceptual framework for care quality. Among those articles referencing a framework, the most common was the Donabedian model (n = 7). Studies operationalized quality constructs in extremely different ways. Few articles included outcomes as a quality construct, and the operationalization of structure varied widely. A key asset of SPA surveys, owing to the standardized structure and use of harmonized data collection instruments, is the potential for cross-survey comparisons. However, this is limited by the lack of a common framework for measuring and reporting quality in the existing literature using SPA data. Service Provision Assessment surveys offer unique and valuable insights, and a common framework and approach would substantially strengthen the body of knowledge on quality of care in low-resource settings.},

To overcome this problem, a cluster analysis is performed to create a service environment variable, which reflects differences in service availability, population size and rurality. Utilization of health services is then modelled as a logistic regression equation where the independent variables are age, sex, service environment and income to test the Birch and Abelson argument. This argument is then extended by controlling for age, health and income status. Based on the modelling results, the importance of geography to access and utilization is assessed.},

	abstract = {Despite some serious past efforts to clarify its multiple dimensions and meanings, access to health care has remained a rather elusive concept, hampering the work of health care policymakers and professionals as they endeavor to effect meaningful health care reform. This article provides perhaps the most detailed clarification of the access concept, especially the crucial linkages among the various access dimensions, and presents a comprehensive conceptual framework for evaluation and planning activities as they relate to people's access to health care services. The proposed conceptual model recognizes access as the outcome of a process involving the interplay between the characteristics of the health care service system and of potential users in a specified area, and moderated by health care related public policy and planning efforts. An elaborate typology of access, incorporating four pairs of access dimensions, is also derived. This atomization of the concept allows us to focus on specific aspects of the access to health care problem, and to develop precise outcome indicators of health system performance for evaluative purposes. Further, it enables the access concept and its pertinent dimensions to be put into proper perspective when assessing the health care access situation in a specific national or regional context. The relevance of the proposed access model and the typology to health care planning in general, and to spatial planning of health care service systems in particular; is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Government efforts designed to help improve healthcare access rely on accurate measures of accessibility so that resources can be allocated to truly needy areas. In order to capture the interaction between physicians and populations, various access measures have been utilized, including the popular two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method. However, despite the many advantages of 2SFCA, the problems associated with using fixed catchment sizes have not been satisfactorily addressed. We propose a new method to dynamically determine physician and population catchment sizes by incrementally increasing the catchment until a base population and a physician-to-population ratio are met. Preliminary application to the ten-county region in northern Illinois has demonstrated that the new method is effective in determining the appropriate catchment sizes across the urban to suburban/rural continuum and has revealed greater detail in spatial variation of accessibility compared to results using fixed catchment sizes.},

	abstract = {Despite the huge differences between developing and developed countries, access is the major issue in rural health around the world. Even in the countries where the majority of the population lives in rural areas, the resources are concentrated in the cities. All countries have difficulties with transport and communication, and they all face the challenge of shortages of doctors and other health professionals in rural and remote areas. Many rural people are caught in the poverty– ill health–low productivity downward spiral, particularly in developing countries. Since 1992, WONCA, the World Organization of Family Doctors, has developed a specific focus on rural health through the WONCA Working Party on Rural Practice. This Working Party has drawn national and international attention to major rural health issues through World Rural Health Conferences and WONCA Rural Policies. The World Health Organization (WHO) has broadened its focus beyond public health to partnership with family practice, initially through a landmark WHO–WONCA Invitational Conference in Canada. From this has developed the Memorandum of Agreement between WONCA and WHO which emphasizes the important role of family practitioners in primary health care and also includes the Rural Health Initiative. In April 2002, WHO and WONCA held a major WHO–WONCA Invitational Conference on Rural Health. This conference addressed the immense challenges for improving the health of people of rural and remote areas of the world and initiated a specific action plan: The Global Initiative on Rural Health. The ‘Health for All’ vision for rural people is more likely to be achieved through joint concerted efforts of international and national bodies working together with doctors, nurses and other health workers in rural areas around the world.},

We observe excess rural mortality until age 15, finding the largest differences between urban and rural sectors among 1–59-month-olds. While we cannot claim higher mortality among urban adults than those in rural areas, we find a reduced gap between the sectors over the life course and a diminishing urban advantage in adult mortality with age. This shift over the life course reflects a divergence in the epidemiologic transition between the rural and urban sectors.},

Health professional education that is sensitive to local population needs and that attends to all elements of the rural pathway is vital to increase the proportion of the health workforce that practices in underserved rural and remote areas. The Training for Health Equity Network (THEnet) is a community-of-practice of 13 health professional education institutions with a focus on delivering socially accountable education to produce a fit-for-purpose health workforce. The THEnet Graduate Outcome Study is an international prospective cohort study with more than 6,000 learners from nine health professional schools in seven countries (including four LMICs; the Philippines, Sudan, South Africa and Nepal). Surveys of learners are administered at entry to and exit from medical school, and at years 1, 4, 7, and 10 thereafter. The association of learners' intention to practice in rural and other underserved areas, and a range of individual and institutional level variables at two time points—entry to and exit from the medical program, are examined and compared between country income settings. These findings are then triangulated with a sociocultural exploration of the structural relationships between educational and health service delivery ministries in each setting, status of postgraduate training for primary care, and current policy settings. This analysis confirmed the association of rural background with intention to practice in rural areas at both entry and exit. Intention to work abroad was greater for learners at entry, with a significant shift to an intention to work in-country for learners with entry and exit data. Learners at exit were more likely to intend a career in generalist disciplines than those at entry however lack of health policy and unclear career pathways limits the effectiveness of educational strategies in LMICs. This multi-national study of learners from medical schools with a social accountability mandate confirms that it is possible to produce a health workforce with a strong intent to practice in rural areas through attention to all aspects of the rural pathway.},

In addition to health systems, social systems, such as schools, communities, families, and digital platforms, can be used to promote health. We did a targeted literature review of how well health and social systems are meeting the needs of children in LMICs using the framework of The Lancet Global Health Commission on high-quality health systems and we reviewed evidence for structural reforms in health and social sectors. We found that quality of services for children is substandard across both health and social systems. Health systems have deficits in care competence (eg, diagnosis and management), system competence (eg, timeliness, continuity, and referral), user experience (eg, respect and usability), service provision for common and serious conditions (eg, cancer, trauma, and mental health), and service offerings for adolescents. Education and social services for child health are limited by low funding and poor coordination with other sectors. Structural reforms are more likely to improve service quality substantially and at scale than are micro-level efforts. Promising approaches include governing for quality (eg, leadership, expert management, and learning systems), redesigning service delivery to maximise outcomes, and empowering families to better care for children and to demand quality care from health and social systems. Additional research is needed on health needs across the life course, health system performance for children and families, and large-scale evaluation of promising health and social programmes.},

Unfortunately, many adolescents in Nigeria face significant barriers to accessing quality sexual and reproductive health services (SRHS), despite national policies promoting SRHS for adolescents. This paper explores the stigma influencing access to and utilization of SRHS among adolescents in Kaduna, Northwestern Nigeria. This qualitative study conducted semi-structured interviews with 14 adolescents and three nurses. Thematic analysis was employed for the study. The findings indicate that although the adolescents knew the importance of accessing SRHS, they were not inclined to utilize the services because of stigma. The stigma-related barriers to accessing SRHS were related to religion, community norms and the negative attitude of the community and health workers all resulting in adolescents feeling shy and ashamed to use SRHS. Suggestions made to address these challenges and promote access included the provision of youth-friendly services (YFS) that respect confidentiality and privacy and also having dedicated youth-only health clinics. Health workers emphasized the need for creating awareness in the community about adolescent SRH and rights and the need to improve resources to provide comprehensive youth-friendly SRHS. There is also the need to introduce targeted stigma reduction training programs for health workers providing youth-friendly services. The findings can inform context-specific interventions in Nigeria and better implementation of the country’s policies related to adolescent SRH.},

	title = {Associations of maternal health care structure and process quality with outcomes in {Malawi}},
	url = {https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/61539},
	abstract = {Background: Recent trends in maternal health in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) show increasing health service utilization without anticipated improvement in outcomes, leading some to question the health care quality. Programs seeking to improve health care quality frequently use the Donabedian quality of care framework as a guide. This study examined the associations among the different dimensions – structure, process, and outcome – of the Donabedian quality of care framework in the Malawi maternal health care context.
Methods: Using data from the 2013 Malawi Service Provision Assessment (SPA), two measures of antenatal and labor and delivery (L\&D) care structure – infrastructure and human resources – and two measures of process – technical and interpersonal – quality were constructed. Spearman’s correlations were used to estimate associations between structure and process elements in antenatal (N=400) and L\&D facilities (N=179). At facilities with observation data from both services (N=149), associations of quality elements between services were assessed. Multilevel path analysis was used estimate direct and indirect effects of structure and process quality elements on outcomes; first patient satisfaction among all antenatal patients (N=2000) and facilities (n=400), and second intention to deliver at the same facility among antenatal patients at facilities which offered both services (N=1817, n=360).
Results: Structure and process quality was poor in both antenatal and L\&D care. Structural quality was positively associated with technical process quality. Neither element of structural quality was associated with interpersonal process quality. Technical, but not interpersonal, process quality was correlated in the two service areas. Better interpersonal process quality, hospitals, private health facilities, as well as lower patient education were significantly associated with higher patient satisfaction. Hospitals, lower patient education, and higher parity were significantly and directly associated with increased intention to deliver at the same facility. Infrastructure had a significantly negative indirect effect on intention to deliver at the same facility through technical process.
Conclusion: These data do not support the Donabedian quality of care framework. This study highlights the need to focus on quality of maternal health care in Malawi, as well as the need to better understand how measurement of quality of care influences associations with patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {Improving the quality of maternal and newborn health (MNH) services is key to reducing adverse MNH outcomes in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). The Service Provision Assessment (SPA) and Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) are the most widely employed, standardised tools that generate health service delivery data in LMICs. We ascertained the use of SPA/SARA surveys for assessing the quality of MNH services using a two-step approach: a SPA/SARA questionnaire mapping exercise in line with WHO’s Quality of Care (QoC) Framework for pregnant women and newborns and the WHO quality standards for care around the time of childbirth; and a scoping literature review, searching for articles that report SPA/SARA data. SPA/SARA surveys are well suited to assess the WHO Framework’s cross-cutting dimensions (physical and human resources); SPA also captures elements in the provision and experience of care domains for antenatal care and family planning. Only 4 of 31 proposed WHO quality indicators around the time of childbirth can be fully generated using SPA and SARA surveys, while 19 and 23 quality indicators can be partially obtained from SARA and SPA surveys, respectively; most of these are input indicators. Use of SPA/SARA data is growing, but there is considerable variation in methods employed to measure MNH QoC. With SPA/SARA data available in 30 countries, MNH QoC assessments could benefit from guidance for creating standard metrics. Adding questions in SPA/SARA surveys to assess the WHO QoC Framework’s provision and experience of care dimensions would fill significant data gaps in LMICs.},

	doi = {10.1016/S2214-109X(16)30180-2},
	abstract = {Background
Global efforts to increase births at health-care facilities might not reduce maternal or newborn mortality if quality of care is insufficient. However, little systematic evidence exists for the quality at health facilities caring for women and newborn babies in low-income countries. We analysed the quality of basic maternal care functions and its association with volume of deliveries and surgical capacity in health-care facilities in five sub-Saharan African countries.
Methods
In this analysis, we combined nationally representative health system surveys (Service Provision Assessments by the Demographic and Health Survery Programme) with data for volume of deliveries and quality of delivery care from Kenya, Namibia, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. We measured the quality of basic maternal care functions in delivery facilities using an index of 12 indicators of structure and processes of care, including infrastructure and use of evidence-based routine and emergency care interventions. We regressed the quality index on volume of births and confounders (public or privately managed, availability of antiretroviral therapy services, availability of skilled staffing, and country) stratified by facility type: primary (no caesarean capacity) or secondary (has caesarean capacity) care facilities. The Harvard University Human Research Protection Program approved this analysis as exempt from human subjects review.
Findings
The national surveys were completed between April, 2006, and May, 2010. Our sample consisted of 1715 (93\%) of 1842 health-care facilities that provided normal delivery service, after exclusion of facilities with missing (n=126) or invalid (n=1) data. 1511 (88\%) study facilities (site of 276 965 [44\%] of 622 864 facility births) did not have caesarean section capacity (primary care facilities). Quality of basic maternal care functions was substantially lower in primary (index score 0·38) than secondary care facilities (0·77). Low delivery volume was consistently associated with poor quality, with differences in quality between the lowest versus highest volume facilities of −0·22 (95\% CI −0·26 to −0·19) in primary care facilities and −0·17 (−0·21 to −0·11) in secondary care facilities.
Interpretation
More than 40\% of facility deliveries in these five African countries occurred in primary care facilities, which scored poorly on basic measures of maternal care quality. Facilities with caesarean section capacity, particularly those with birth volumes higher than 500 per year, had higher scores for maternal care quality. Low-income and middle-income countries should systematically assess and improve the quality of delivery care in health facilities to accelerate reduction of maternal and newborn deaths.

	abstract = {Objective Increasing the availability of basic healthcare services in low-and middle-income countries is not sufficient to meet the Sustainable Development Goal target for child survival in high-mortality settings, where healthcare utilisation is often inconsistent and quality of care can be poor. We assessed whether poor quality of sick child healthcare in Malawi is associated with low utilisation of sick child healthcare.
Design We measured two elements of quality of sick child healthcare: facility structural readiness and process of care using data from the 2013 Malawi Service Provision Assessment. Overall quality was defined as the average of these metrics. We extracted demographic data from the 2013–2014 Malawi Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey and linked households to nearby facilities using geocodes. We used logistic regression to examine the association of facility quality with utilisation of formal health services for children under 5 years of age suffering diarrhoea, fever or cough/acute respiratory illness, controlling for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. We conducted sensitivity analyses (SAs), modifying the travel distance and population—facility matching criteria.
Setting and population 568 facilities were linked with 9701 children with recent illness symptoms in Malawi, of whom 69\% had been brought to a health facility.
Results Overall, facilities showed gaps in structural quality (62\% readiness) and major deficiencies in process quality (33\%), for an overall quality score of 48\%. Better facility quality was associated with higher odds of utilisation of sick child healthcare services (adjusted ORs (AOR): 1.66, 95\% CI: 1.04 to 2.63), as was structural quality alone (AOR: 1.33, 95\% CI: 0.95 to 1.87). SAs supported the main finding.
Conclusion Although Malawi’s health facilities for curative child care are widely available, quality and utilisation of sick child healthcare services are in short supply. Improving facility quality may provide a way to encourage higher utilisation of healthcare, thereby decreasing preventable childhood morbidity and mortality.},

	abstract = {Forty years ago, the 134 national government members of the WHO signed the Alma Ata Declaration. The Declaration made Primary Health Care (PHC) the official health policy of all members countries. Emerging from the conference was the consensus that health was a human right based on the principles of equity and community participation. Alma Ata broadened the perception of health beyond doctors and hospitals to social determinants and social justice. In the following years implementing this policy confronted many challenges. These included: (1) whether PHC should focus on vertical disease programmes where interventions had the most possibility of success or on comprehensive programmes that addressed social, economic and political factors that influenced health improvements; (2) whether primary care and PHC are interchangeable approaches to health improvements; (3) how equity and community participation for health improvements would be institutionalised; and (4) how financing for PHC would be possible. Experiences in implementation over the last 40 years provide evidence of how these challenges have been met and what succeeded and what had failed. Lessons from these experiences include the need to understand PHC as a process rather than a blueprint, to understand the process must consider context, culture, politics, economics and social concerns, and therefore, to recognise the process is complex. PHC needs to be examined within evaluation frameworks that address complexity. Recent developments in monitoring and evaluation have begun to respond to this need. They include realist evaluation and implementation research.},

	abstract = {Background Geographical accessibility to healthcare is an important component of infectious disease dynamics. Timely access to health facilities can prevent disease progression and enables disease notification through surveillance systems. The importance of accounting for physical accessibility in response to infectious diseases is increasingly recognized. Yet, there is no comprehensive review of the literature available on infectious diseases in relation to geographical accessibility to care. Therefore, we aimed at evaluating the current state of knowledge on the effect of geographical accessibility to health care on infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries. Methods and findings A search strategy was developed and conducted on Web of Science and PubMed on 4 March 2019. New publications were checked until May 28, 2020. All publication dates were eligible. Data was charted into a tabular format and descriptive data analyses were carried out to identify geographical regions, infectious diseases, and measures of physical accessibility among other factors. Search queries in PubMed and Web of Science yielded 560 unique publications. After title and abstract screening 99 articles were read in full detail, from which 64 articles were selected, including 10 manually. Results of the included publications could be broadly categorized into three groups: (1) decreased spatial accessibility to health care was associated with a higher infectious disease burden, (2) decreased accessibility was associated to lower disease reporting, minimizing true understanding of disease distribution, and (3) the occurrence of an infectious disease outbreak negatively impacted health care accessibility in affected regions. In the majority of studies, poor geographical accessibility to health care was associated with higher disease incidence, more severe health outcomes, higher mortality, and lower disease reporting. No difference was seen between countries or infectious diseases. Conclusions Currently, policy-makers and scientists rely on data collected through passive surveillance systems, introducing uncertainty on disease estimates for remote communities. Our results highlight the need for increasing integration of geographical accessibility measures in disease risk modelling, allowing more realistic disease estimates and enhancing our understanding of true disease burden. Additionally, disease risk estimates could be used in turn to optimize the allocation of health services in the prevention and detection of infectious diseases.},

Goal number five aimed to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters and provide universal access to reproductive healthcare services by 2015. While there has been some progress, MDG 5 fell far short of target goals, highlighting the necessity of further improvement in global maternal health. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), this study aims to understand how distance to facility and quality of care, which are components of access, affect maternal service utilization in two of the world’s poorest countries, Haiti and Kenya. Furthermore, this study examines how this relationship may change or hold between urban and rural regions. Data from the United States Agency for International Development Demographic and Health Survey and Service Provision Assessment were linked spatially in a GIS model, drawing comparisons among distance to facility, quality of care, and maternal health service utilization. Results show that in both rural and urban regions, access to maternal health service and maternal health service utilization share a similar spatial pattern. In urban regions, pockets of maternal health disparities exist despite close distance to facility and standard quality of care. In rural regions, there are areas with long distances to facilities and low quality of care, resulting in poor maternal service usage. This study highlights the usefulness of GIS as a tool to evaluate disparities in maternal healthcare provision and usage.},

Quality-of-care indicators are compared between the public and private sectors along three dimensions: structure, process and outcome.Private facilities were superior to public sector facilities in terms of physical infrastructure and the availability of services. Public sector facilities were more likely to have management systems in place. There was no difference between public and private providers in the technical quality of care provided. Private providers were better at managing interpersonal aspects of care. The higher level of client satisfaction at private facilities could not be explained by differences between public and private facilities in structural and process aspects of care.Formal private sector facilities providing family planning services exhibit greater readiness to provide services and greater attention to client needs than public sector facilities in Kenya. Consistent with this, client satisfaction is much higher at private facilities. Technical quality of care provided is similar in public and private facilities.},

It is perceptions of quality, rather than clinical indicators of quality, that drive service utilization and are essential to increasing demand. Here we reflect on the nature of quality, how perceptions of quality influence health systems and what such perceptions indicate about measurement of quality within health systems. We discuss six specific challenges related to the conceptualization and measurement of the quality of care: perceived quality as a driver of service utilization; quality as a concept shaped over time through experience; responsiveness as a key attribute of quality; the role of management and other so-called upstream factors; quality as a social construct co-produced by families, individuals, networks and providers; and the implications of our observations for measurement. Within the communities and societies where care is provided, quality of care cannot be understood outside social norms, relationships, trust and values. We need to improve not only technical quality but also acceptability, responsiveness and levels of patient–provider trust. Measurement approaches need to be reconsidered. An improved understanding of all the attributes of quality in health systems and their interrelationships could support the expansion of access to essential health interventions.},

	abstract = {Background
Despite large investments in the public health care system, disparities in health outcomes persist between lower- and upper-income individuals, as well as rural vs urban dwellers in Ethiopia. Evidence from Ethiopia and other low- and middle-income countries suggests that challenges in health care access may contribute to poverty in these settings.

Methods
We employed a two-step floating catchment area to estimate variations in spatial access to health care and in staffing levels at health care facilities. We estimated the average travel time from the population centers of administrative areas and adjusted them with provider-to-population ratios. To test hypotheses about the role of travel time vs staffing, we applied Spearman’s rank tests to these two variables against the access score to assess the significance of observed variations.

Results
Among Ethiopia’s 11 first-level administrative units, Addis Ababa, Dire Dawa, and Harari had the best access scores. Regions with the lowest access scores were generally poorer and more rural/pastoral. Approximately 18\% of the country did not have access to a public health care facility within a two-hour walk. Our results suggest that spatial access and staffing issues both contribute to access challenges.

Conclusion
Investments both in new health facilities and staffing in existing facilities will be necessary to improve health care access within Ethiopia. Because rural and low-income areas are more likely to have poor access, future strategies for expanding and strengthening the health care system should strongly emphasize equity and the role of improved access in reducing poverty.},

We estimated the proportion of women within two hours of the nearest delivery facility, both currently and under redesign.

A policy of redesign would reduce two-hour access by at most 10 percent, ranging from 0.6 percent in Malawi to 9.9 percent in Tanzania.

	abstract = {Objectives
Antenatal care (ANC) during pregnancy and skilled birth attendance (SBA) during delivery are important policy concerns to reduce maternal deaths. Bangladesh is one of the developing countries which has made remarkable progress in both services during the last couple of decades by improving the SBA service rate from 16\% in 2004 to 42.1\% in 2014. However, this rate remains below the targeted level (50\%) of the Health Population and Nutrition Sector Development Program set by the Ministry of the Health and Family Welfare of Bangladesh. This article explored the sociodemographic factors associated with the ANC and SBA service attainment. Furthermore, the possible implication of using ANC on SBA was also investigated.
Study design
The study followed a cross-sectional design using the Bangladesh demographic and health survey 2014, with a sample of size 4603 women with at least one live birth 3 years preceding the survey.
Methods
Following a bivariate analysis, linear mixed-effect models were used to assess the relationship between sociodemographic factors and the outcome indicators (ANC and SBA). Finally, the association between SBA and ANC was evaluated through another mixed-effect model.
Results
Wealth index, participation in household decisions, and partner's and respondent's education were significant predictors of ANC; whereas, residence, age at first birth, wealth index, working status, participation in household decisions, and partner and respondent's education were significant for SBA. Female education and household affordability were the strongest predictors for both ANC and SBA. ANC showed significant association with SBA as women accessing essential ANC during delivery seemed to be 4 times more likely (95\% confidence interval: 3.05–5.93) to avail SBA services.
Conclusions
Overall, four factors were significant: residence, wealth index, education, and ANC access. Women residing in urban areas, having higher financial solvency, completing higher education, and accessing ANC by skilled personnel were more likely to receive SBA at delivery than their counterparts. Accessibility to skilled care during pregnancy leads to increased professional care during delivery. Thus, policies to encourage women and heads of families to seek skilled care during pregnancy would be beneficial to reach the maternal healthcare targets of Bangladesh.},

To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, the rate of decline in prevalence of maternal and child mortality, stillbirths, and stunting among children younger than 5 years of age needs to accelerate considerably compared with progress since 2000. Such accelerations are only possible with a rapid scale-up of effective interventions to all population groups within countries (particularly in countries with the highest mortality and in those affected by conflict), supported by improvements in underlying socioeconomic conditions, including women's empowerment. Three main conclusions emerge from our analysis of intervention coverage, equity, and drivers of reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health (RMNCH) in the 81 Countdown countries. First, even though strong progress was made in the coverage of many essential RMNCH interventions during the past decade, many countries are still a long way from universal coverage for most essential interventions. Furthermore, a growing body of evidence suggests that available services in many countries are of poor quality, limiting the potential effect on RMNCH outcomes. Second, within-country inequalities in intervention coverage are reducing in most countries (and are now almost non-existent in a few countries), but the pace is too slow. Third, health-sector (eg, weak country health systems) and non-health-sector drivers (eg, conflict settings) are major impediments to delivering high-quality services to all populations. Although more data for RMNCH interventions are available now, major data gaps still preclude the use of evidence to drive decision making and accountability. Countdown to 2030 is investing in improvements in measurement in several areas, such as quality of care and effective coverage, nutrition programmes, adolescent health, early childhood development, and evidence for conflict settings, and is prioritising its regional networks to enhance local analytic capacity and evidence for RMNCH.},

	abstract = {On the continuum of maternal health care, two extreme situations exist: too little, too late (TLTL) and too much, too soon (TMTS). TLTL describes care with inadequate resources, below evidence-based standards, or care withheld or unavailable until too late to help. TLTL is an underlying problem associated with high maternal mortality and morbidity. TMTS describes the routine over-medicalisation of normal pregnancy and birth. TMTS includes unnecessary use of non-evidence-based interventions, as well as use of interventions that can be life saving when used appropriately, but harmful when applied routinely or overused. As facility births increase, so does the recognition that TMTS causes harm and increases health costs, and often concentrates disrespect and abuse. Although TMTS is typically ascribed to high-income countries and TLTL to low-income and middle-income ones, social and health inequities mean these extremes coexist in many countries. A global approach to quality and equitable maternal health, supporting the implementation of respectful, evidence-based care for all, is urgently needed. We present a systematic review of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for routine antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal care, categorising them as recommended, recommended only for clinical indications, and not recommended. We also present prevalence data from middle-income countries for specific clinical practices, which demonstrate TLTL and increasing TMTS. Health-care providers and health systems need to ensure that all women receive high-quality, evidence-based, equitable and respectful care. The right amount of care needs to be offered at the right time, and delivered in a manner that respects, protects, and promotes human rights.},

	abstract = {How do we explain the paradox that Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in health and human development, yet its achievements have taken place within a health system that is frequently characterised as weak, in terms of inadequate physical and human infrastructure and logistics, and low performing? We argue that the development of a highly pluralistic health system environment, defined by the participation of a multiplicity of different stakeholders and agents and by ad hoc, diffused forms of management has contributed to these outcomes by creating conditions for rapid change. We use a combination of data from official sources, research studies, case studies of specific innovations, and in-depth knowledge from our own long-term engagement with health sector issues in Bangladesh to lay out a conceptual framework for understanding pluralism and its outcomes. Although we argue that pluralism has had positive effects in terms of stimulating change and innovation, we also note its association with poor health systems governance and regulation, resulting in endemic problems such as overuse and misuse of drugs. Pluralism therefore requires active management that acknowledges and works with its polycentric nature. We identify four key areas where this management is needed: participatory governance, accountability and regulation, information systems, and capacity development. This approach challenges some mainstream frameworks for managing health systems, such as the building blocks approach of the WHO Health Systems Framework. However, as pluralism increasingly defines the nature and the challenge of 21st century health systems, the experience of Bangladesh is relevant to many countries across the world.},

Bangladesh's inability to provide quality healthcare services, along with issues pertaining to limited resources, absenteeism, poor governance, and lack of accountability in its public healthcare system have created wide gaps that are increasingly being filled by the private sector. This has been fuelled by the state's investment in medical education and training of public sector physicians while simultaneously permitting them to practice privately, as well as the provision of grants and subsidies. The growth of this sector has limited benefits for the improvement of people's health.

It is based on an extensive review of both published and unpublished documents including journal articles, government reports, policy and planning documents, as well as reports of United Nations, the World Health Organisation and the World Bank. Different search engines and databases were used to collect the documents. Thematic data analysis techniques were used in developing the text. Private provision of healthcare services raises concerns about social justice and the right to healthcare. This sector to some extent is unable to fulfil its obligation to realise social justice and the right to healthcare in the provision of healthcare. An expanding private sector role creates complexities in promoting and protecting the right to health and social justice.

This study explores the existing health policy environment and current activities to further the progress towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and the challenges faced in these endeavors. This qualitative study involved document reviews (n=22) and key informant interviews (KII, n=15). Thematic analysis of texts (themes: activities around UHC, implementation barriers, suggestions) was done using the manual coding technique. We found that Bangladesh has a comprehensive set of policies for UHC, e.g., a health-financing strategy and staged recommendations for pooling of funds to create a national health insurance scheme and expand financial protection for health. Progress has been made in a number of areas including the roll out of the essential package of health services for all, expansion of access to primary health care services (support by donors), and the piloting of health insurance which has been piloted in three subdistricts. Political commitment for these areas is strong. However, there are barriers pertaining to the larger policy level which includes a rigid public financing structure dating from the colonial era. While others pertain to the health sector’s implementation shortfalls including issues of human resources, political interference, monitoring, and supervision, most key informants discussed demand-side barriers too, such as sociocultural disinclination, historical mistrust, and lack of empowerment. To overcome these, several policies have been recommended, e.g., redesigning the public finance structure, improving governance and regulatory mechanism, specifying code of conduct for service providers, introducing health-financing reform, and collaborating with different sectors. To address the implementation barriers, recommendations include improving service quality, strengthening overall health systems, improving health service management, and improving monitoring and supervision. Addressing demand-side barriers, such as patient education and community empowerment, is also needed. Research and advocacy are required to address crosscutting barriers such as the lack of common understanding of UHC.},

	abstract = {The health system of Bangladesh relies heavily on the government or the public sector for financing and setting overall policies and service delivery mechanisms. Although the health system is faced with many intractable challenges, it seems to receive little priority in terms of national resource allocation. According to the World Health Organization (WHO 2010) only about 3\% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is spent on health services. However, government expenditure on health is only about 34\% of the total health expenditure (THE), the rest (66\%) being out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses. Inequity, therefore, is a serious problem affecting the health care system. Based on a review of secondary data, the paper assesses the current challenges and opportunities of the health system in Bangladesh. The findings suggest that although the health system faces multifaceted challenges such as lack of public health facilities, scarcity of skilled workforce, inadequate financial resource allocation and political instability; Bangladesh has demonstrated much progress in achieving the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) especially MDG 4 and MDG 5. Although the country has a growing private sector primarily providing tertiary level health care services, Bangladesh still does not have a comprehensive health policy to strengthen the entire health system. Clearly, the most crucial challenge is the absence of a dynamic and proactive stewardship able to design and enforce policies to further strengthen and enhance the overall health system. Such strong leadership could bring about meaningful and effective health system reform, which will work more efficiently for the betterment of the health of the people of Bangladesh, and would be built upon the values of equity and accountability.},

Malaria data was extracted from the Health Management Information System (HMIS). General service and malaria-specific readiness indicators were obtained from the 2013 Uganda service delivery indicator survey. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was used to construct a composite facility readiness score based on multiple factorial axes. Geostatistical models assessed the effect of facility readiness on malaria deaths and severe cases. Malaria readiness was achieved in one-quarter of the facilities. The composite readiness score explained 48\% and 46\% of the variation in the original indicators compared to 23\% and 27\%, explained by the first axis alone for HCIIIs and HCIIs, respectively. Mortality rate was 64\% (IRR = 0.36, 95\% BCI: 0.14–0.61) and 68\% (IRR = 0.32, 95\% BCI: 0.12–0.54) lower in the medium and high compared to low readiness groups, respectively. A composite readiness index is more informative and consistent than the one based on the first MCA factorial axis. In Uganda, higher facility readiness is associated with a reduced risk of severe malaria outcomes.},

Primary care has the potential to address a large proportion of people's health needs, promote equity, and contain costs, but only if it provides high-quality health services that people want to use. 40 years after the Declaration of Alma-Ata, little is known about the quality of primary care in low-income and middle-income countries. We assessed whether existing facility surveys capture relevant aspects of primary care performance and summarised the quality of primary care in ten low-income and middle-income countries.

We used Service Provision Assessment surveys, the most comprehensive nationally representative surveys of health systems, to select indicators corresponding to three of the process quality domains (competent systems, evidence-based care, and user experience) identified by the Lancet Global Health Commission on High Quality Health Systems in the Sustainable Development Goals Era. We calculated composite and domain quality scores for first-level primary care facilities across and within ten countries with available facility assessment data (Ethiopia, Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Nepal, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda).
Findings
Data were available for 7049 facilities and 63 869 care visits. There were gaps in measurement of important outcomes such as user experience, health outcomes, and confidence, and processes such as timely action, choice of provider, affordability, ease of use, dignity, privacy, non-discrimination, autonomy, and confidentiality. No information about care competence was available outside maternal and child health. Overall, scores for primary care quality were low (mean 0·41 on a scale of 0 to 1). At a domain level, scores were lowest for user experience, followed by evidence-based care, and then competent systems. At the subdomain level, scores for patient focus, prevention and detection, technical quality of sick-child care, and population-health management were lower than those for other subdomains.
Interpretation
Facility surveys do not capture key elements of primary care quality. The available measures suggest major gaps in primary care quality. If not addressed, these gaps will limit the contribution of primary care to reaching the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals.

To evaluate the service readiness of health facilities in Bangladesh, Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Nepal, Rwanda, Senegal, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania.

Methods
Using existing data from service provision assessments of the health systems of the 10 study countries, we calculated a service readiness index for each of 8443 health facilities. This index represents the percentage availability of 50 items that the World Health Organization considers essential for providing health care. For our analysis we used 37–49 of the items on the list. We used linear regression to assess the independent explanatory power of four national and four facility-level characteristics on reported service readiness.

Findings
The mean values for the service readiness index were 77\% for the 636 hospitals and 52\% for the 7807 health centres/clinics. Deficiencies in medications and diagnostic capacity were particularly common. The readiness index varied more between hospitals and health centres/clinics in the same country than between them. There was weak correlation between national factors related to health financing and the readiness index.

Conclusion
Most health facilities in our study countries were insufficiently equipped to provide basic clinical care. If countries are to bolster health-system capacity towards achieving universal coverage, more attention needs to be given to within-country inequities.},

Efficient measurement requires knowing how long measures of quality provide consistent insight for intended uses. Methods We used a repeated health facility assessment in Senegal to calculate structural and process quality of antenatal care (ANC), delivery and child health services in facilities assessed 2 years apart. We tested agreement of quality measures within facilities and regions. We estimated how much input-adjusted and process quality-adjusted coverage measures changed for each service when calculated using quality measurements from the same facilities measured 2 years apart. Results Over 6 waves of continuous surveys, 628 paired assessments were completed. Changes at the facility level were substantial and often positive, but inconsistent. Structural quality measures were moderately correlated (0.40–0.69) within facilities over time, more so in hospitals; correlation was {\textless}0.20 for process measures based on direct observation of ANC and child visits. Most measures were more strongly correlated once averaged to regions; process quality of child services was not (−0.32). Median relative difference in national-adjusted coverage estimates was 6.0\%; differences in subnational estimates were largest for process quality of child services (19.6\%). Conclusion Continuous measures of structural quality demonstrated consistency at regional levels and in higher level facilities over 2 years; results for process measures were mixed. Direct observation of child visits provided inconsistent measures over time. For other measures, linking population data with health facility assessments from up to 2 years prior is likely to introduce modest measurement error in adjusted coverage estimates.},

Their adoption by global institutions has further captured the attention of the media and policymakers around the globe, and their number of applications has surged ever since. This increase in their popularity has solicited a plethora of methodological contributions in response to the substantial criticism surrounding their underlying framework. In this paper, we put composite indicators under the spotlight, examining the wide variety of methodological approaches in existence. In this way, we offer a more recent outlook on the advances made in this field over the past years. Despite the large sequence of steps required in the construction of composite indicators, we focus particularly on two of them, namely weighting and aggregation. We find that these are where the paramount criticism appears and where a promising future lies. Finally, we review the last step of the robustness analysis that follows their construction, to which less attention has been paid despite its importance. Overall, this study aims to provide both academics and practitioners in the field of composite indices with a synopsis of the choices available alongside their recent advances.},

	abstract = {Background Geographic access to obstetric care facilities has a significant influence on women’s uptake of institutional delivery care. However, this effect was not consistent across studies. Some studies reported that geographic access to obstetric care facilities had no influence on the use of facility delivery. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized and pooled the influence of geographic access on institutional delivery service uptake in low and middle-income countries. Methods Multiple combinations of search terms were used to search articles from six databases and a hand search of reference lists performed. We included observational studies conducted in low and middle-income countries which reported the influence of geographic access on delivery care use. The pooled effects of geographic access on institutional delivery care use were calculated using a random-effects model with a 95\% confidence interval. Findings In this study a total of 31 studies were included. Among these studies, 15 met criteria for inclusion in the meta-analyses, while the remaining 16 were summarized using qualitative synthesis. Studies included in the analysis where women had to walk 60 minutes or less to access a health facility delivery were significantly heterogeneous. Having access to obstetric care facilities within five kilometres was significantly associated with institutional deliveries (pooled OR = 2.27; 95\% CI = 1.82, 2.82). Similarly, a travelling time of 60 minutes or less was significantly associated with higher odds of health facility delivery (pooled OR = 3.30; 95\% CI = 1.97, 5.53). Every one-hour and one-kilometre increase in travel time and distance, respectively, was negatively associated with institutional delivery care use. Interpretation Geographic access measured in either physical distance and/or travel time was significantly associated with women’s use of facility delivery. The greater the distance and/or travel time to obstetric care facilities, the greater the barrier and the lesser the service uptake.},

	abstract = {Objectives To investigate how the quality of maternal health services and travel times to health facilities affect birthing service utilisation in Eastern Region, Ghana.
Design The study is a cross-sectional spatial interaction analysis of birth service utilisation patterns. Routine birth data were spatially linked to quality care, service demand and travel time data.
Setting 131 Health facilities (public, private and faith-based) in 33 districts in Eastern Region, Ghana.
Participants Women who gave birth in health facilities in the Eastern Region, Ghana in 2017.
Outcome measures The count of women giving birth, the quality of birthing care services and the geographic coverage of birthing care services.
Results As travel time from women’s place of residence to the health facility increased up to two2 hours, the utilisation rate markedly decreased. Higher quality of maternal health services haves a larger, positive effect on utilisation rates than service proximity. The quality of maternal health services was higher in hospitals than in primary care facilities. Most women (88.6\%) travelling via mechanised transport were within two2 hours of any birthing service. The majority (56.2\%) of women were beyond the two2 -hour threshold of critical comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care (CEmONC) services. Few CEmONC services were in urban centres, disadvantaging rural populations.
Conclusions To increase birthing service utilisation in Ghana, higher quality health facilities should be located closer to women, particularly in rural areas. Beyond Ghana, routinely collected birth records could be used to understand the interaction of service proximity and quality.},

	abstract = {The quality of care provided by health systems contributes towards efforts to reach sustainable development goal 3 on health and well-being. There is growing evidence that the impact of health interventions is undermined by poor quality of care in lower-income countries. Quality of care will also be crucial to the success of universal health coverage initiatives; citizens unhappy with the quality and scope of covered services are unlikely to support public financing of health care. Moreover, an ethical impetus exists to ensure that all people, including the poorest, obtain a minimum quality standard of care that is effective for improving health. However, the measurement of quality today in low- and middle-income countries is inadequate to the task. Health information systems provide incomplete and often unreliable data, and facility surveys collect too many indicators of uncertain utility, focus on a limited number of services and are quickly out of date. Existing measures poorly capture the process of care and the patient experience. Patient outcomes that are sensitive to health-care practices, a mainstay of quality assessment in high-income countries, are rarely collected. We propose six policy recommendations to improve quality-of-care measurement and amplify its policy impact: (i) redouble efforts to improve and institutionalize civil registration and vital statistics systems; (ii) reform facility surveys and strengthen routine information systems; (iii) innovate new quality measures for low-resource contexts; (iv) get the patient perspective on quality; (v) invest in national quality data; and (vi) translate quality evidence for policy impact.},

	abstract = {Background Further improvements in population health in low- and middle-income countries demand high-quality care to address an increasingly complex burden of disease. Health facility surveys provide an important but costly source of information on readiness to provide care. To improve the efficiency of health system measurement, we applied unsupervised machine learning methods to assess the performance of the service readiness index (SRI) defined by the World Health Organization and compared it to empirically derived indices. Methods We drew data from nationally representative Service Provision Assessment surveys conducted in 10 countries between 2007 and 2015. We extracted 649 items in domains such as infrastructure, medication, and management to calculate an index using all available information and classified facilities into quintiles. We compared three approaches against the full item set: the SRI, a new index based on sequential backward selection, and an enriched SRI that added empirically selected items to the SRI. We evaluated index performance with a cross-validated kappa statistic comparing classification using the candidate index against the 649-item index. Results 9238 facilities were assessed. The 49-item SRI performed poorly against the index using all 649 items, with a kappa value of 0.35. New empirically derived indices with 50 and 100 items captured much more information, with cross-validated kappa statistics of 0.71 and 0.80, respectively. Items varied across the indices and in sensitivity analyses. A 100-item enriched SRI reliably captured the information from the full index: 83\% of the facilities were classified into correct quintiles of service readiness based on the full index. Conclusion A facility readiness measure developed by global health experts performed poorly in capturing the totality of readiness information collected during facility surveys. Using a machine learning approach with sequential selection and cross-validation to identify the most informative items dramatically improved performance. Such approaches can make assessment of health facility readiness more efficient. Further improvements in measurement will require identification of external criteria—such as patient outcomes—to guide and validate measure development.},

	abstract = {Access to healthcare is a requirement for human well-being that is constrained, in part, by the allocation of healthcare resources relative to the geographically dispersed human population1–3. Quantifying access to care globally is challenging due to the absence of a comprehensive database of healthcare facilities. We harness major data collection efforts underway by OpenStreetMap, Google Maps and academic researchers to compile the most complete collection of facility locations to date. Leveraging the geographically variable strengths of our facility datasets, we use an established methodology4 to characterize travel time to healthcare facilities in unprecedented detail. We produce maps of travel time with and without access to motorized transport, thus characterizing travel time to healthcare for populations distributed across the wealth spectrum. We find that just 8.9\% of the global population (646 million people) cannot reach healthcare within one hour if they have access to motorized transport, and that 43.3\% (3.16 billion people) cannot reach a healthcare facility by foot within one hour. Our maps highlight an additional vulnerability faced by poorer individuals in remote areas and can help to estimate whether individuals will seek healthcare when it is needed, as well as providing an evidence base for efficiently distributing limited healthcare and transportation resources to underserved populations both now and in the future.},

	abstract = {Introduction Studies on the determinants of contraceptive use often consider distance to the nearest health facility offering contraception as a key explanatory variable. Women, however, may not seek contraception from the nearest facility, rather opting for a more distant facility with better quality services or to ensure greater privacy and anonymity.
Methods The dataset used include the name of facility where each women obtained contraception, measures of facility quality, and the distance between each woman’s home and 39 potential facilities she might visit. We use a conditional-multinomial logit model to estimate the determinants of her facility choice to visit and how women tradeoff travelling longer distances to use higher quality facilities.
Results Only 33\% of woman who received contraception from a health facility used their nearest facility. While the nearest facility was 1.2 km away, the average distance to facility used was 2.9 km, indicating women are willing to travel significantly longer distances for higher quality. Women prefer facilities that specialise in providing contraception, provide a large range of methods, do not suffer from stock outs and do not charge fees. Furthermore, on average, women are willing to travel an additional 2 km for a facility that offers more family planning methods, 4.7 km for a facility without one additional health service, 9 km for a facility without fees for contraception and 11 km for a facility not experiencing stock out of an additional contraception.
Conclusion Our results suggest that quality of services provided is an important driver of facility choice in addition to distance to facility.},

Goal number five aimed to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters and provide universal access to reproductive healthcare services by 2015. While there has been some progress, MDG 5 fell far short of target goals, highlighting the necessity of further improvement in global maternal health. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), this study aims to understand how distance to facility and quality of care, which are components of access, affect maternal service utilization in two of the world's poorest countries, Haiti and Kenya. Furthermore, this study examines how this relationship may change or hold between urban and rural regions. Data from the United States Agency for International Development Demographic and Health Survey and Service Provision Assessment were linked spatially in a GIS model, drawing comparisons among distance to facility, quality of care, and maternal health service utilization. Results show that in both rural and urban regions, access to maternal health service and maternal health service utilization share a similar spatial pattern. In urban regions, pockets of maternal health disparities exist despite close distance to facility and standard quality of care. In rural regions, there are areas with long distances to facilities and low quality of care, resulting in poor maternal service usage. This study highlights the usefulness of GIS as a tool to evaluate disparities in maternal healthcare provision and usage.},

	abstract = {Universal access to health care requires service availability and accessibility for those most in need of maternal and child health services. Women often bypass facilities closest to home due to poor quality. Few studies have directly linked individuals to facilities where they sought maternal and child health services and examined the role of distance and quality on this facility choice. Using endline data from a longitudinal survey from a sample of women in five cities in Kenya, we examine the role of distance and quality on facility selection for women using delivery, facility-based contraceptives, and child health services. A survey of public and private facilities offering reproductive health services was also conducted. Distances were measured between household cluster location and both the nearest facility and facility where women sought care. A quality index score representing facility infrastructure, staff, and supply characteristics was assigned to each facility. We use descriptive statistics to compare distance and quality between the nearest available facility and visited facility among women who bypassed the nearest facility. Facility distance and quality comparisons were also stratified by poverty status. Logistic regression models were used to measure associations between the quality and distance to the nearest facility and bypassing for each outcome. The majority of women bypassed the nearest facility regardless of service sought. Women bypassing for delivery traveled the furthest and had the fewest facility options near their residential cluster. Poor women bypassing for delivery traveled 4.5 km further than non-poor women. Among women who bypassed, two thirds seeking delivery and approximately 46\% seeking facility-based contraception or child health services bypassed to a public hospital. Both poor and non-poor women bypassed to higher quality facilities. Our findings suggest that women in five cities in Kenya prefer public hospitals and are willing to travel further to obtain services at public hospitals, possibly related to free service availability. Over time, it will be important to examine service quality and availability in public sector facilities with reduced or eliminated user fees, and whether it lends itself to a continuum of care where women can visit one facility for multiple services reducing travel burden.},

	abstract = {Despite substantial improvements in several maternal health indicators, childbearing and birthing remain a dangerous experience for many women in Bangladesh. This study assessed the relative importance of maternal healthcare service characteristics to Bangladeshi women when choosing a health facility to deliver their babies. The study used a mixed-methods approach. Qualitative methods (expert interviews, focus group discussions) were initially employed to identify and develop the characteristics which most influence a women’s decision making when selecting a maternal health service facility. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was then constructed to elicit women’s preferences. Women were shown choice scenarios representing hypothetical health facilities with nine attributes outlined. The women were then asked to rank the attributes they considered most important in the delivery of their future babies. A Hierarchical Bayes method was used to measure mean utility parameters. A total of 601 women completed the DCE survey. The model demonstrated significant predictive strength for actual facility choice for maternal health services. The most important attributes were the following: consistent access to a female doctor, the availability of branded drugs, respectful provider attitudes, a continuum of maternal healthcare including the availability of a C-section delivery and lesser waiting times. Attended maternal healthcare utilisation rates are low despite the access to primary healthcare facilities. Further implementation of quality improvements in maternal healthcare facilities should be prioritised.},

The utilisation of healthcare facilities in South Africa is such that more households prefer public healthcare facilities more than other healthcare facilities. The multinomial logit model was used, with traditional/self-medication category as the reference or baseline category. The results indicated that gender, income and access to grants were significant in influencing the probability of a household choosing a public healthcare facility, while age, income, grants, salaries/wages/commission and pensions were significant in influencing the choice of private healthcare institutions. Therefore the study recommends that due to a large portion of households that are using public health facilities compared to private and traditional facilities, the government must invest more in public healthcare facilities in South Africa.},

Recent literature has shown an increased risk of C. difficile infection (CDI) with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use.OBJECTIVETo conduct a systematic assessment of the risk of hospital-acquired CDI following exposure to PPI.METHODSWe searched multiple databases for studies examining the relationship between PPI and hospital-acquired CDI. Pooled odds ratios were generated and assessment for heterogeneity performed.RESULTSWe found 23 observational studies involving 186,033 cases that met eligibility criteria. Across studies, 10,307 cases of hospital-acquired CDI were reported. Significant heterogeneity was present; therefore, a random effects model was used. The pooled odds ratio was 1.81 (95\% CI, 1.52–2.14), favoring higher risk of CDI with PPI use. Significant heterogeneity was present, likely due to differences in assessment of exposure, study population, and definition of CDI.DISCUSSIONThis meta-analysis suggests PPIs significantly increase the risk of hospital-acquired CDI. Given the significant health and economic burden of CDI and the risks of PPI, optimization of PPI use should be included in a multifaceted approach to CDI prevention.Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2016;1408–1417},

To complete this analysis, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalysis (PRISMA) identified 875 articles in common and retrieved a total of 34 articles that met the inclusion criteria, consisted of OEF/OIF Hispanic veterans, reported quantitative data, and were conducted with adult U.S. veterans living in the United States. Since TBI diagnosis was unclear in most articles, only five articles that used the VATBIST instrument were analyzed. The results suggested that there is a lack of research on OEF/OIF Hispanic veterans and Hispanic subgroups.

Current state-of-the-art estimates of bilateral migration flows rely on the assumption that the number of global migrants is as small as possible. We relax this assumption, producing complete estimates of all between-country migration flows with genuine estimates of total global migration. We find that the total number of individuals migrating internationally has oscillated between 1.13 and 1.29\% of the global population per 5-year period since 1990. Return migration and transit migration are big parts of total migration; roughly one of four migration events is a return to an individual’s country of birth. In the most recent time period, we estimate particularly large return migration flows from the United States to Central and South America and from the Persian Gulf to south Asia.},

	abstract = {Measuring and forecasting migration patterns has important implications for understanding broader population trends, for designing policy effectively and for allocating resources. However, data on migration and mobility are often lacking, and those that do exist are not available in a timely manner. Social media data offer new opportunities to provide more up-to-date demographic estimates and to complement more traditional data sources. Facebook’s Advertising Platform, for example, is a potentially rich data source of demographic information that is regularly updated. However, Facebook’s users are not representative of the underlying population. This paper proposes a statistical framework to combine social media data with traditional survey data to produce timely ‘nowcasts’ of migrant stocks by state in the United States. The model incorporates bias adjustment of Facebook data, and a pooled principal component time series approach, to account for correlations across age, time and space. We use the model to estimate and project migrants from Mexico, India and Germany, three migrant groups with varying levels and trends of migration in the US. By comparing short-term projections with data from the American Community Survey, we show that the model predictions outperform alternatives that rely solely on either social media or survey data.},

New dams and water transfer schemes are being constructed, but they are both controversial and unlikely to fully satisfy demand. Alien species of trees and plants have invaded many parts of the country, taking over land from indigenous species. These alien species consume much more water than the indigenous vegetation, as well as threatening biodiversity and constituting a significant fire hazard. The Working for Water Programme, established in 1995, and working in partnership with local communities, aims to clear invasive alien species and thus increase water supply. The programme is examined in terms of its impact on environment and the livelihoods of predominantly poor rural communities. Questions are raised about the future sustainability of the programme.

	abstract = {This paper explores loss in childbearing in Malawi (miscarriages, perinatal deaths and maternal mortality) as a lens to understand accountability and health system functioning. In low-income countries, maternal and perinatal mortality reflects poor health system functioning, to be improved in part through accountability. Understanding how accountability plays out on the ground requires examination of the existing, ‘organic’ accountability relationships and mechanisms. Thematic and discourse analysis of interviews and observations illuminates vocabularies of responsibility and practices of accountability concerning loss. Women are especially held accountable for loss, by a range of social actors. They use existing ‘organic’ accountability relationships and mechanisms to manage their own interests, but arguably also to care for pregnant women, even though negative birth experiences may ensue. Instances of disrespectful care appear a by-product of the convergence of organic and orchestrated, policy-driven accountability for numeric outcomes (deaths averted) rather than process (quality of care). Moreover, in the absence of essential physical resources, providers and relatives mobilize the social resources at their disposal to keep women and babies alive. Improving quality of care requires acknowledgment that providers' actions are both systemic and situational, and embedded in local moral landscapes and uneven webs of accountability.},

This fast-growing market has pressured multinational mining companies operating in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the world's largest supplier of cobalt, to formalize artisanal mining under the banner of responsible sourcing. Based on field research in the cobalt-rich Province of Lualaba, survey data and interviews with relevant actors, this article examines the integration of artisanal miners in corporate-led formalization projects. First, we suggest that the reliance on wageless artisanal workers in large-scale industrial operations holds important lessons for understanding the unintended effects of mining formalization. Second, the flexible recruitment of artisanal workers by mining companies represents an emergent trend of corporate outsourcing of responsibility.},

	abstract = {The analysis of the spatiotemporal variability of wind power remains limited during the planning stage of an offshore wind farm. This study provides a framework to investigate how offshore wind power varies along the Central California Coast over diurnal and seasonal time scales, which is critical for reliability and functionality of the grid system. We find that offshore wind power in this region peaks during evening hours across all seasons and maximizes in spring and summer. The timing of peak offshore wind power production better aligns with that of peak demand across California than solar and land-based wind power production, highlighting its potential to fill the supply gap when demand is high and power production from other renewable energy sources is low. We further assess the value of offshore wind power using demand-based and wholesale market metrics. Both metrics indicate high potential value of offshore wind power over most areas in this region. Finally, we show that the estimate of power production is significantly biased when using mean wind speeds that do not account for temporal variability, leading to potentially inaccurate predictions about locations that are expected to produce the most power. These results reiterate the importance in considering spatiotemporal variability in wind power for accurately calculating the value of offshore wind development.},

This paper examines the experiences of Malawi in tackling the problem of high infant and childhood mortality over recent decades, 1990–2010. We highlight the strategies that were used in Malawi which led to Malawi’s stellar performance in achieving the targets set by the MDGs with reference to infant and childhood mortality. The data for the analysis were obtained from Demographic and Health Surveys and from the various censuses the country has conducted. Regression analysis using district as the unit of observation reveals several important factors that have led to the commendable declines in infant mortality. Significant factors included immunisation of infants as well as increasing levels of female education and the availability of skilled birth attendants. What Malawi’s case demonstrates is that given a correct mix of strategies, even a poor country such as Malawi can meet some of the lofty targets set by the MDGs.},

	abstract = {Background Globally, approximately 3 million babies die annually within their first month. Access to adequate care at birth is needed to reduce newborn as well as maternal deaths. We explore the influence of distance to delivery care and of level of care on early neonatal mortality in rural Zambia and Malawi, the influence of distance (and level of care) on facility delivery, and the influence of facility delivery on early neonatal mortality. Methods and Findings National Health Facility Censuses were used to classify the level of obstetric care for 1131 Zambian and 446 Malawian delivery facilities. Straight-line distances to facilities were calculated for 3771 newborns in the 2007 Zambia DHS and 8842 newborns in the 2004 Malawi DHS. There was no association between distance to care and early neonatal mortality in Malawi (OR 0.97, 95\%CI 0.58–1.60), while in Zambia, further distance (per 10 km) was associated with lower mortality (OR 0.55, 95\%CI 0.35–0.87). The level of care provided in the closest facility showed no association with early neonatal mortality in either Malawi (OR 1.02, 95\%CI 0.90–1.16) or Zambia (OR 1.02, 95\%CI 0.82–1.26). In both countries, distance to care was strongly associated with facility use for delivery (Malawi: OR 0.35 per 10km, 95\%CI 0.26–0.46). All results are adjusted for available confounders. Early neonatal mortality did not differ by frequency of facility delivery in the community. Conclusions While better geographic access and higher level of care were associated with more frequent facility delivery, there was no association with lower early neonatal mortality. This could be due to low quality of care for newborns at health facilities, but differential underreporting of early neonatal deaths in the DHS is an alternative explanation. Improved data sources are needed to monitor progress in the provision of obstetric and newborn care and its impact on mortality.},

	abstract = {The Malawi Journals Project is one of the longest-running observational field studies in rural sub-Saharan Africa, ongoing since 1999. The journals provide real-time accounts of the unfolding epidemic, from the days when AIDS was considered by rural Malawians to be a death sentence, through the advent of international AIDS organisations bearing advice on avoiding infections by self-control, and then the turn to institutionally-based efforts to control infection through HIV testing and antiretroviral medications. This paper examines the epistemological and substantive contributions of the Journals Project, which we and others who have analysed the journals have made to understanding the AIDS epidemic. The paper has three primary aims. The first is to provide evidence of the chasm between the top-down perspectives of global actors with a mandate to address the pandemic and the bottom-up perspectives of local actors trying to avoid dying from AIDS, perspectives that are often contradictory. Second, beyond what can be learned from the journals about individual and collective responses to AIDS, they suggest the value of longitudinal observational field studies as a method for understanding how cultural change occurs. And third, as an example of the potential of longitudinal field studies as a research method on AIDS as well as other topics, we have structured our argument around the broader empirical and theoretical debates in the social sciences featured in published and presented analyses of the Malawi journals data: multiple moral logics, the course of global flows of information and injunctions, and the collective deliberation that produces authoritative local knowledge.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a newly developed interactive elicitation methodology for collecting probabilistic expectations in a developing country context with low levels of literacy and numeracy, and we evaluate the feasibility and success of this method for a wide range of outcomes in rural Malawi. We find that respondents’ answers about their subjective expectations take into account basic properties of probabilities, and vary meaningfully with observable characteristics and past experience. From a substantive point of view, the elicited expectations indicate that individuals are generally aware of differential risks. For example, individuals with lower incomes and less land rightly feel at greater risk of financial distress than people with higher socioeconomic status (SES), and people who are divorced or widowed rightly feel at greater risk of being infected with HIV than currently married individuals. Meanwhile many expectations—including the probability of being currently infected with HIV—are well-calibrated compared to actual probabilities, but mortality expectations are substantially overestimated compared to life table estimates. This overestimation may lead individuals to underestimate the benefits of adopting HIV risk-reduction strategies. The skewed distribution of expectations about condom use also suggests that a small group of innovators are the forerunners in the adoption of condoms within marriage for HIV prevention.},

	abstract = {In high-income countries, emerging research suggests sibling bereavement can have significant health and life course consequences for young people. Yet, we know far less about its burden in lower-income countries. Due to higher fertility and mortality in lower-income countries, the level, timing, intensity, and circumstances surrounding sibling mortality are likely to follow patterns distinct from those in higher-income settings. Thus, in this study, we offer a descriptive overview of sibling death in 43 countries across sub-Saharan Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Specifically, we analyze Demographic and Health Survey data from nationally representative samples of 352,930 15- to 34-year-old women, born between 1985 and 2003, to document experiences of sibling death before age 25. On average, roughly one-third of individuals report a deceased sibling in these countries; estimates reach 40–50\% of respondents in multiple African countries, particularly those that have experienced conflict and war. Although some sibling deaths occurred before the focal respondent was born, most bereaved individuals recalled a death during their lifetime—often in late childhood/early adolescence. High proportions of bereaved respondents report multiple sibling deaths, highlighting the clustering of deaths within families. Even so, bereaved individuals tend to come from large families and thus frequently have a comparable number of surviving siblings as people who never experienced a sibling die. Together, the results offer a window into global inequality in childhood experiences, and they attest to the need for research that explores the implications of sibling mortality for young people in world regions where the experience is concentrated.},

The widespread practice of polygyny is one feature of many sub-Saharan African contexts that may be relevant to understanding patterns of infant mortality. Building on evidence that the prevalence of polygyny reflects broader economic, social, and cultural features and that it has implications for how families engage in the practice, we investigate whether and how the prevalence of polygyny (1) spills over to elevate infant mortality for all families, and (2) conditions the survival disadvantage for children living in polygynous families (i.e., compared with monogamous families). We use data from Demographic and Health Surveys to estimate multilevel hazard models that identify associations between infant mortality and region-level prevalence of polygyny for 236,336 children in 260 subnational regions across 29 sub-Saharan African countries. We find little evidence that the prevalence of polygyny influences mortality for infants in nonpolygynous households net of region-level socioeconomic factors and gender inequality. However, the prevalence of polygyny significantly amplifies the survival disadvantage for infants in polygynous families. Our findings demonstrate that considering the broader marital context reveals important insights into the relationship between family structure and child well-being.},

We use detailed reproductive data in combination with fine-scale climate data to examine pregnancy outcomes among women in sub-Saharan Africa, a region that shelters some of the poorest families in the world. Fine-scale precipitation and temperature data allow each pregnancy to be matched to the relevant climate exposures. We investigate the linkages between climate and pregnancy outcomes using linear probability models with fixed effects to minimize confounding due to factors that vary by location, season, and year. We analyze retrospective pregnancy data from more than 65,000 pregnancies recorded in 23 surveys across 15 African countries. Our results indicate that pregnancy outcomes are indeed impacted by exposure to hot days even after considering other individual-level characteristics. This research provides insight into the linkages between climate and a major adverse health outcome faced by women. In doing so, this research expands scientific understanding of the impact of environmental factors on fertility outcomes.},

With nearly 40\% of the U.S. population being residents of coastal areas, understanding the anticipated demographic changes in coastal counties is important for long-range planning purposes. In this research note, we use long-range, county-level population projections based on a simplified cohort-component method to discuss demographic changes by age, sex, and race and ethnicity for coastal counties between 2020 and the end of the century, and we compare these changes to inland counties. Presently, coastal counties are statistically significantly different from inland counties by race and ethnicity (more diverse) and sex (more women) but not by age, yet by 2025, we expect coastal counties to become significantly older than inland counties. We note several important trajectories of predicted demographic outcomes in coastal counties across the remainder of the century: (1) the non-Hispanic White population is expected to decrease, both numerically and as a percentage of the population; (2) the population older than 65 is projected to increase, both numerically and as a percentage of the population; and (3) the ratio of women to men remains constant over the century at 1.03. These trends combine to suggest that the future U.S. coastline will likely be both increasingly diverse racially and ethnically and significantly older than it is today.},

	abstract = {All species have an environmental niche, and despite technological advances, humans are unlikely to be an exception. Here, we demonstrate that for millennia, human populations have resided in the same narrow part of the climatic envelope available on the globe, characterized by a major mode around ∼11 °C to 15 °C mean annual temperature (MAT). Supporting the fundamental nature of this temperature niche, current production of crops and livestock is largely limited to the same conditions, and the same optimum has been found for agricultural and nonagricultural economic output of countries through analyses of year-to-year variation. We show that in a business-as-usual climate change scenario, the geographical position of this temperature niche is projected to shift more over the coming 50 y than it has moved since 6000 BP. Populations will not simply track the shifting climate, as adaptation in situ may address some of the challenges, and many other factors affect decisions to migrate. Nevertheless, in the absence of migration, one third of the global population is projected to experience a MAT {\textgreater}29 °C currently found in only 0.8\% of the Earth’s land surface, mostly concentrated in the Sahara. As the potentially most affected regions are among the poorest in the world, where adaptive capacity is low, enhancing human development in those areas should be a priority alongside climate mitigation.},

I argue that the changing ecological environment of Lake Victoria, Africa’s largest freshwater lake, mapping onto a gendered economy, shaped fisherfolk’s sexual relationships and sexual mixing patterns in ways that were consequential for their HIV risk. Specifically, I show how disrupted lake and fish ecology had an impact on fishermen’s sexual, domestic and economic partnerships, as well as how it contributed to the “sex for fish” economy in Nyanza Province, Kenya. I also show the consequences of fishermen’s relative wealth on transactional relationships with school girls and women in lakeside communities. The paper is based on ethnographic fieldwork over a seven month period among the Luo ethnic group, which has the highest HIV rates in Kenya. The study included 74 individual and focus group interviews in communities around Lake Victoria, as well as 20 key informant interviews. Additionally, literature reviews on fishing and sexual economies as well as on ecological research in Lake Victoria are employed. Exploring linkages between these literatures and fieldwork findings forms the basis of this paper. I argue that solely focusing on individual level HIV prevention strategies is limited without taking into account the eco-social context of individual sexual decision making.},

Adjusting for preexisting health and socioeconomic conditions attenuates, but does not eliminate, these associations. The findings, while drawn from a demographically unique sample, suggest that, to mitigate the indirect effects of COVID-19, lapses in medical care and medication use must be minimized, and public health resources should be directed to those with preexisting medical conditions, their social networks, and the bereaved.},

The hurricane's adverse impact on survivors' mental health was apparent shortly after the storm and persisted, but no study has examined the long-term effects now that more than a decade has transpired. Using new data from a panel study of low-income mothers interviewed once before Hurricane Katrina and now three times after, we document changes in mental health, and estimate the sociodemographic and hurricane-related factors associated with long-term trajectories of mental health. We find that post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) declined at each of the three post-Katrina follow-ups, but 12 years after the hurricane, one in six still had symptoms indicative of probable post-traumatic stress disorder. The rate of non-specific psychological distress (PD) remained consistently higher in all three follow-ups, compared to the pre-disaster period. In full covariate-adjusted models, no sociodemographic variables predicted long-run combinations of PTSS and PD. However, 12 years later, exposure to hurricane-related traumatic events and pre-disaster PD significantly predicted co-occurring PTSS and PD. Hurricane-related housing damage predicted PTSS in earlier follow-ups, but no longer predicted PTSS in the long-term. Furthermore, hurricane-related traumatic events significantly differentiated the risk of having persistent PTSS, relative to recovering from PTSS. The results suggest that there is still a non-negligible group of survivors with continued need for recovery resources and that exposure to traumatic events is a primary predictor of adverse mental health more than a decade post-disaster.},

To evaluate this model, we follow 1,266 children in Chicago from birth through school entry and track both their areal risk of lead exposure and their neighborhoods' socioeconomic composition over time. With these data, we estimate the joint effects of neighborhood poverty and environmental lead contamination on receptive vocabulary ability.

	abstract = {Agent-based modeling is a simulation method in which autonomous agents interact with their environment and one another, given a predefined set of rules. It is an integral method for modeling and simulating complex systems, such as socio-economic problems. Since agent-based models are not described by simple and concise mathematical equations, the code that generates them is typically complicated, large, and slow. Here we present Agents.jl, a Julia-based software that provides an ABM analysis platform with minimal code complexity. We compare our software with some of the most popular ABM software in other programming languages. We find that Agents.jl is not only the most performant but also the least complicated software, providing the same (and sometimes more) features as the competitors with less input required from the user. Agents.jl also integrates excellently with the entire Julia ecosystem, including interactive applications, differential equations, parameter optimization, and so on. This removes any “extensions library” requirement from Agents.jl, which is paramount in many other tools.},

The original contribution of this survey is two-fold: (1) Present a concise characterization of almost the entire spectrum of agent-based modelling and simulation tools, thereby highlighting the salient features, merits, and shortcomings of such multi-faceted application software; this article covers eighty five agent-based toolkits that may assist the system designers and developers with common tasks, such as constructing agent-based models and portraying the real-time simulation outputs in tabular/graphical formats and visual recordings. (2) Provide a usable reference that aids engineers, researchers, learners and academicians in readily selecting an appropriate agent-based modelling and simulation toolkit for designing and developing their system models and prototypes, cognizant of both their expertise and those requirements of their application domain. In a nutshell, a significant synthesis of Agent Based Modelling and Simulation (ABMS) resources has been performed in this review that stimulates further investigation into this topic.},

In addition, we tested the association between specific characteristics of community environments and child nutritional status.DesignCross-sectional survey.SettingThe data are from the nationally representative 2004 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey.SubjectsRespondents were ever-married women (aged 15–49 years) and their children (n 5731), residing in 361 communities. Child nutritional outcomes are physical measurements of weight-for-age and height-for-age in sd units. We considered the following attributes of community environments potentially related to child nutrition: (i) community water and sanitation infrastructure; (ii) availability of community health and education services; (iii) community employment and social participation; and (iv) education level of the community.ResultsMultilevel regression analysis showed that the spatial distribution of maternal and child covariates did not entirely explain the between-community variation in child nutritional status. The education level of the community emerged as the strongest community-level predictor of child height-for-age (highest v. lowest tertile, β = 0·18 (se 0·07)) and weight-for-age (highest v. lowest tertile, β = 0·21 (se 0·06)). In the height-for-age model, community employment and social participation also emerged as being statistically significant (highest v. lowest tertile, β = 0·13 (se = 0·06)).ConclusionsThe community environment influences child nutrition in Bangladesh, and maternal- and child-level covariates may fail to capture the entire influence of communities. Interventions to reduce child undernutrition in developing countries should take into consideration the wider community context.},

We examine the consequences of prenatal exposure for infant health, through which the pandemic may have lasting intergenerational effects. We examine multiple pathways by which the pandemic shaped birth outcomes and socioeconomic disparities in these consequences. Analysis of more than 3.5 million birth records in California with universal information on COVID infection among persons giving birth at the time of delivery reveals deep inequalities in infection by education, race/ethnicity, and place-based socioeconomic disadvantage. COVID infection during pregnancy, in turn, predicts a large increase in the probability of preterm birth, by approximately one third. At the population level, a surprising reduction in preterm births during the first months of the pandemic was followed by an increase in preterm births during the surge in COVID infections in the winter of 2021. Whereas the early-pandemic reduction in preterm births benefited primarily highly educated mothers, the increase in preterm births during the winter infection surge was entirely concentrated among mothers with low levels of schooling. The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to exacerbate U.S. inequality in multiple ways. Our findings highlight a particularly enduring pathway: the long-term legacy of prenatal exposure to an unequal pandemic environment.},

Yet, estimating the consequences of prenatal stress on children’s outcomes is complicated by the issue of confounding (i.e., unobserved factors correlated with stress exposure and with children’s outcomes). I combine a natural experiment—a strong earthquake in Chile—with a panel survey to capture the effect of prenatal exposure on acute stress and children’s cognitive ability. I find that stress exposure in early pregnancy has no effect on children’s cognition among middle-class families, but it has a strong negative influence among disadvantaged families. I then examine possible pathways accounting for the socioeconomic stratification in the effect of stress, including differential exposure across socioeconomic status, differential sensitivity, and parental responses. Findings suggest that the interaction between prenatal exposures and socioeconomic advantage provides a powerful mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of disadvantage.},

	abstract = {Changes in fertility patterns are hypothesized to be among the many second-order consequences of armed conflict, but expectations about the direction of such effects are theoretically ambiguous. Prior research, from a range of contexts, has also yielded inconsistent results. We contribute to this debate by using harmonized data and methods to examine the effects of exposure to conflict on preferred and observed fertility outcomes across a spatially and temporally extensive population. We use high-resolution georeferenced data from 25 sub-Saharan African countries, combining records of violent events from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) with data on fertility goals and outcomes from the Demographic and Health Surveys (n = 368,765 women aged 15–49 years). We estimate a series of linear and logistic regression models to assess the effects of exposure to conflict events on ideal family size and the probability of childbearing within the 12 months prior to the interview. We find that, on average, exposure to armed conflict leads to modest reductions in both respondents’ preferred family size and their probability of recent childbearing. Many of these effects are heterogeneous between demographic groups and across contexts, which suggests systematic differences in women’s vulnerability or preferred responses to armed conflict. Additional analyses suggest that conflict-related fertility declines may be driven by delays or reductions in marriage. These results contribute new evidence about the demographic effects of conflict and their underlying mechanisms, and broadly underline the importance of studying the second-order effects of organized violence on vulnerable populations.},

In districts highly affected by the flu there is also an improvement in parental quality: we observe a relative increase in births to married women and better-off city dwellers.Our findings help understand the link between mortality and fertility, one of the central relations in demography, and show that several factors – including disruptions to marriage and labor markets – contribute to fertility reduction in the long term.

We investigate the fertility response to an unanticipated mortality shock that resulted from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which killed large shares of the residents of some Indonesian communities but caused no deaths in neighboring communities. Using population-representative multilevel longitudinal data, we identify a behavioral fertility response to mortality exposure, both at the level of a couple and in the broader community. We observe a sustained fertility increase at the aggregate level following the tsunami, which was driven by two behavioral responses to mortality exposure. First, mothers who lost one or more children in the disaster were significantly more likely to bear additional children after the tsunami. This response explains about 13 \% of the aggregate increase in fertility. Second, women without children before the tsunami initiated family-building earlier in communities where tsunami-related mortality rates were higher, indicating that the fertility of these women is an important route to rebuilding the population in the aftermath of a mortality shock. Such community-level effects have received little attention in demographic scholarship.},

	abstract = {The salutary effect of formal education on health-risk behaviors and mortality is extensively documented: ceteris paribus, greater educational attainment leads to healthier lives and longevity. Even though the epidemiological evidence has strongly indicated formal education as a leading “social vaccine,” there is intermittent reporting of counter-education gradients for health-risk behavior and associated outcomes for certain populations during specific periods. How can education have both beneficial and harmful effects on health, and under which contexts do particular effects emerge? It is useful to conceptualize the influence of education as a process sensitive to the nature, timing of entry, and uniqueness of a new pleasurable and desirable lifestyle and/or product (such as smoking) with initially unclear health risks for populations. Developed herein is a hypothesis that the education gradient comprises multiple potent pathways (material, psychological, cognitive) by which health-risk behaviors are influenced, and that there can be circumstances under which pathways act in opposite directions or are differentially suppressed and enhanced. We propose the population education transition (PET) curve as a unifying functional form to predict shifting education gradients across the onset and course of a population’s exposure to new health risks and their associated consequences. Then, we estimate PET curves for cases with prior epidemiological evidence of heterogeneous education gradients with health-risk behaviors related to mass-produced cigarettes in China and the United States; saturated fats, sugar, and processed food diets in Latin America; and HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. Each offers speculation on interactions between environmental factors during population exposure and education pathways to health-risk behaviors that could be responsible for the temporal dynamics of PET curves. Past epidemiological studies reporting either negative or positive education gradients may not represent contradictory findings as much as come from analyses unintentionally limited to just one part of the PET process. Last, the PET curve formulation offers richer nuances about educational pathways, macro-historical population dynamics, and the fundamental cause of disease paradigm.},

To address the effect of education on health in general, three contributions are provided: 1) a macro-level summary of the dimensions of the worldwide educational revolution and a reassessment of its causal role in the health of individuals and in the demographic health transition are carried out; 2) a meta-analysis of methodologically sophisticated studies of the effect of educational attainment on all-cause mortality is conducted to establish the independence and robustness of the education effect on health; and 3) a schooling-cognition hypothesis about the influence of education as a powerful determinant of health is developed in light of new multidis-ciplinary cognitive research.},

First, we draw on recent brain and cognition research to contextualize fertility intentions within a broader set of conscious and unconscious mechanisms that contribute to mental function. Next, we integrate this research with social theory. Our conceptualizations suggest that people do not necessarily have fertility intentions; they form them only when prompted by specific situations. Intention formation draws on the current situation and on schemas of childbearing and parenthood learned through previous experience, imbued by affect, and organized by self-representation. Using this conceptualization, we review apparently discordant knowledge about the value of fertility intentions in predicting fertility. Our analysis extends and deepens existing explanations for the weak predictive validity of fertility intentions at the individual level and provides a social-cognitive explanation for why intentions predict as well as they do. When focusing on the predictive power of intentions at the aggregate level, our conceptualizations lead us to focus on how social structures frustrate or facilitate intentions and how the structural environment contributes to the formation of reported intentions in the first place. Our analysis suggests that existing measures of fertility intentions are useful but to varying extents and in many cases despite their failure to capture what they seek to measure.},

	abstract = {Understanding how having children influences parents’ subjective well-being (“happiness”) has great potential to explain fertility behavior. We study parental happiness trajectories before and after the birth of a child, using large British and German longitudinal data sets. We account for unobserved parental characteristics using fixed-effects models and study how sociodemographic factors modify the parental happiness trajectories. Consistent with existing work, we find that happiness increases in the years around the birth of a first child and then decreases to before-child levels. Moreover, happiness increases before birth, suggesting that the trajectories may capture not only the effect of the birth but also the broader process of childbearing, which may include partnership formation and quality. Sociodemographic factors strongly modify this pattern. Those who have children at older ages or who have more education have a particularly positive happiness response to a first birth; and although having the first two children increases happiness, having a third child does not. The results, which are similar in Britain and Germany, suggest that having up to two children increases happiness, and mostly for those who have postponed childbearing. This pattern is consistent with the fertility behavior that emerged during the second demographic transition and provides new insights into low and late fertility.},

We compare the relationships and fertility behaviors of three groups: exclusively heterosexual (consistent heterosexual behavior, identity, and attraction); mostly heterosexual (heterosexual identity with same-sex behavior and/or same-sex attraction); and LGBTQ (any non-heterosexual identity). We find that mostly heterosexual and LGBTQ women behave differently from exclusively heterosexual women in ways likely to elevate their risk of unintended pregnancy: more distinct partners during the study period, more sexual intercourse with men, less frequent contraceptive use, less use of a dual method (condom plus hormonal method), and more gaps in contraceptive coverage. Mostly heterosexual women resemble LGBTQ women in their contraceptive behavior but have significantly more intercourse with men, which may increase their pregnancy risk relative to both LGBTQ and exclusively heterosexual women. We conclude by considering implications for LGBTQ health and the measurement of sexual minority populations.},

However, in practice, it is difficult to disentangle the role of social interaction from other factors, such as individual and family background variables. We measure social interaction through the cross-sibling influences on fertility. Continuous-time hazard models are estimated separately for women’s first and second births. In addition to individual socioeconomic variables, demographic variables, and an unobserved factor specific to each sibling pair, siblings’ birth events and their timing enter as time-varying covariates. We use data from longitudinal population-wide Norwegian administrative registers. The data cover more than 110,000 sibling pairs and include the siblings’ fertility, education, income, and marital histories. Our results indicate that cross-sibling influences are relatively strong for the respondents’ first births but weak for the second parity transition.},

	abstract = {Access to healthcare is a requirement for human well-being that is constrained, in part, by the allocation of healthcare resources relative to the geographically dispersed human population1–3. Quantifying access to care globally is challenging due to the absence of a comprehensive database of healthcare facilities. We harness major data collection efforts underway by OpenStreetMap, Google Maps and academic researchers to compile the most complete collection of facility locations to date. Leveraging the geographically variable strengths of our facility datasets, we use an established methodology4 to characterize travel time to healthcare facilities in unprecedented detail. We produce maps of travel time with and without access to motorized transport, thus characterizing travel time to healthcare for populations distributed across the wealth spectrum. We find that just 8.9\% of the global population (646 million people) cannot reach healthcare within one hour if they have access to motorized transport, and that 43.3\% (3.16 billion people) cannot reach a healthcare facility by foot within one hour. Our maps highlight an additional vulnerability faced by poorer individuals in remote areas and can help to estimate whether individuals will seek healthcare when it is needed, as well as providing an evidence base for efficiently distributing limited healthcare and transportation resources to underserved populations both now and in the future.},

The unit-indexed population variables of interest are typically dependent within cluster. We propose a Fully Bayesian method that constructs an exact likelihood for the observed sample to incorporate unit-level marginal sampling weights for performing unbiased inference for population parameters while simultaneously accounting for the dependence induced by sampling clusters of units to produce correct uncertainty quantification. Our approach parameterizes cluster-indexed random effects in both a marginal model for the response and a conditional model for published, unit-level sampling weights. We compare our method to plug-in Bayesian and frequentist alternatives in a simulation study and demonstrate that our method most closely achieves correct uncertainty quantification for model parameters, including the generating variances for cluster-indexed random effects. We demonstrate our method in an application with NHANES data.KEY WORDS: Inclusion probabilities; Mixed-effects linear model; NHANES; Primary stage sampling unit; Sampling weights; Survey sampling.},

In sub-Saharan Africa, the first cohorts to benefit from policies that expanded access to education are now reaching adulthood and beginning childbearing. I investigate whether the expansion of education in Malawi, which implemented a free primary education policy in 1994 and subsequently expanded secondary schooling, has led to a later age at first birth and whether the education gradient in fertility timing has remained stable over time. Despite increases in female grade attainment over the past twenty years, the age at first birth has not changed. Using instrumental variables analysis, I find a significant negative association between grade attainment and age at first birth, suggesting that the deterioration of school quality and shift in the age pattern of enrollment that accompanied educational expansion may have compromised the transformative potential of education.},

We develop a theoretical argument about the emerging consequences of this stage of the gender revolution and review research results that bear on it. The argument compares the determinants and consequences of recent family trends in industrialized societies provided by two narratives: the SDT and the gender revolution in the public and private spheres. Our argument examines differences in theoretical foundations and positive vs. negative implications for the future. We focus primarily on the growing evidence for turnarounds in the relationships between measures of women's human capital and union formation, fertility, and union dissolution, and consider evidence that men's home involvement increases union formation and fertility and decreases union instability. Although the family trends underlying the SDT and the gender revolution narratives are ongoing and a convincing view of the phenomenon has not yet emerged, the wide range of recent research results documenting changing, even reversing relationships suggests that the gender approach is increasingly the more fruitful one.},

More specifically, we find pervasive evidence that Pakistanis continue childbearing to have a son, to have more than one son and to have at least one daughter.

	abstract = {Introduction Reducing maternal mortality remains a priority for global health. One in five maternal deaths, globally, are from Nigeria. Objective This study aimed to assess the sociocultural correlates of maternal mortality in Nigeria. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of nationally representative data from the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey. The analysis was based on responses from the core women’s questionnaire. Maternal mortality was categorized as ‘yes’ for any death while pregnant, during delivery or two months after delivery (as reported by the sibling), and ‘no’ for deaths of other or unknown causes. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was conducted to test for association between maternal mortality and predictor variables of sociocultural status (educational attainment, community women’s education, region, type of residence, religion, and women’s empowerment). Results Region, Religion, and the level of community women’s education were independently associated with maternal mortality. Women in the North West were more than twice as likely to report maternal mortality (OR: 2.14; 95\% CI: 1.42–3.23) compared to those in the North Central region. Muslim women were 52\% more likely to report maternal deaths (OR: 1.52; 95\% CI: 1.10–2.11) compared to Christian women. Respondents living in communities where a significant proportion of women have at least secondary schooling were 33\% less likely to report that their sisters died of pregnancy-related causes (OR: 0.67; 95\% CI: 0.48–0.95). Conclusion Efforts to reduce maternal mortality should implement tailored programs that address barriers to health-seeking behavior influenced by cultural beliefs and attitudes, and low educational attainment. Strategies to improve women’s agency should be at the core of these programs; they are essential for reducing maternal mortality and achieving sustainable development goals towards gender equality. Future studies should develop empirically evaluated measures which assess, and further investigate the association between women’s empowerment and maternal health status and outcomes.},

We question the emphasis on such individually-based risk factors and argue that greater attention must be paid to basic social conditions if health reform is to have its maximum effect in the time ahead. There are two reasons for this claim. First we argue that individually-based risk factors must be contextualized, by examining what puts people at risk of risks, if we are to craft effective interventions and improve the nation's health. Second, we argue that social factors such as socioeconomic status and social support are likely "fundamental causes" of disease that, because they embody access to important resources, affect multiple disease outcomes through multiple mechanisms, and consequently maintain an association with disease even when intervening mechanisms change. Without careful attention to these possibilities, we run the risk of imposing individually-based intervention strategies that are ineffective and of missing opportunities to adopt broad-based societal interventions that could produce substantial health benefits for our citizens.},

This study examines disparities in overall health among transgender men, transgender women, gender-nonconforming adults, and cisgender (nontransgender) men and women in the U.S. population. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 32 U.S. states and territories between 2014 and 2016 yield an analytic sample that identifies 2,229 transgender and gender-nonconforming adults and 516,753 cisgender adults. Estimates from logistic regression models, using cisgender men as a reference group, show that gender-nonconforming respondents have significantly higher odds of reporting poor self-rated health than any other gender identity group. Transgender men also display higher odds of reporting poor health in some models, corresponding to their relative socioeconomic disadvantage. I find no apparent health disadvantage among transgender women and a persistent, if slight, disadvantage among cisgender women. Gender-nonconforming respondents’ predicted probabilities of reporting poor health remain nearly twice as high as those of cisgender men after adjustments for demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors. Their persistent patterns of health-related disadvantage underscore the need for higher-quality data on gender-nonconforming respondents that account for sex assigned at birth.},

	abstract = {In this research note, I estimate one component of the mortality impact of denying all wanted induced abortions in the United States. This estimate quantifies the magnitude of an increase in pregnancy-related deaths that would occur solely because of the greater mortality risk of continuing a pregnancy rather than having a legal induced abortion. Using published statistics on pregnancy-related mortality ratios, births, and abortions, I estimate U.S. pregnancy-related deaths by race and ethnicity before and in the first and subsequent years of a hypothetical total abortion ban. The number of estimated deaths following a total abortion ban is determined by assuming three conditions: that all wanted induced abortions are denied, that each abortion denied leads to 0.8 births, and that there is a corresponding increase in exposure to pregnancy-related mortality. I find that in the first year of such a ban, estimated pregnancy-related deaths would increase from 675 to 724 (49 additional deaths, representing a 7\% increase), and in subsequent years to 815 (140 additional deaths, for a 21\% increase). Non-Hispanic Black people would experience the greatest increase in deaths (a 33\% increase in subsequent years). Estimated pregnancy-related deaths would increase for all races and ethnicities examined. Overall, denying all wanted induced abortions in the United States would increase pregnancy-related mortality substantially, even if the rate of unsafe abortion did not increase.},

	abstract = {Policy Points Changes in US state policies since the 1970s, particularly after 2010, have played an important role in the stagnation and recent decline in US life expectancy. Some US state policies appear to be key levers for improving life expectancy, such as policies on tobacco, labor, immigration, civil rights, and the environment. US life expectancy is estimated to be 2.8 years longer among women and 2.1 years longer among men if all US states enjoyed the health advantages of states with more liberal policies, which would put US life expectancy on par with other high-income countries. Context Life expectancy in the United States has increased little in previous decades, declined in recent years, and become more unequal across US states. Those trends were accompanied by substantial changes in the US policy environment, particularly at the state level. State policies affect nearly every aspect of people's lives, including economic well-being, social relationships, education, housing, lifestyles, and access to medical care. This study examines the extent to which the state policy environment may have contributed to the troubling trends in US life expectancy. Methods We merged annual data on life expectancy for US states from 1970 to 2014 with annual data on 18 state-level policy domains such as tobacco, environment, tax, and labor. Using the 45 years of data and controlling for differences in the characteristics of states and their populations, we modeled the association between state policies and life expectancy, and assessed how changes in those policies may have contributed to trends in US life expectancy from 1970 through 2014. Findings Results show that changes in life expectancy during 1970-2014 were associated with changes in state policies on a conservative-liberal continuum, where more liberal policies expand economic regulations and protect marginalized groups. States that implemented more conservative policies were more likely to experience a reduction in life expectancy. We estimated that the shallow upward trend in US life expectancy from 2010 to 2014 would have been 25\% steeper for women and 13\% steeper for men had state policies not changed as they did. We also estimated that US life expectancy would be 2.8 years longer among women and 2.1 years longer among men if all states enjoyed the health advantages of states with more liberal policies. Conclusions Understanding and reversing the troubling trends and growing inequalities in US life expectancy requires attention to US state policy contexts, their dynamic changes in recent decades, and the forces behind those changes. Changes in US political and policy contexts since the 1970s may undergird the deterioration of Americans’ health and longevity.},

	abstract = {There is an expectation that, on average, pain will increase with age, through accumulated injury, physical wear and tear, and an increasing burden of disease. Consistent with that expectation, pain rises with age into old age in other wealthy countries. However, in America today, the elderly report less pain than those in midlife. This is the mystery of American pain. Using multiple datasets and definitions of pain, we show today’s midlife Americans have had more pain throughout adulthood than did today’s elderly. Disaggregating the cross-section of ages by year of birth and completion of a bachelor’s degree, we find, for those with less education, that each successive birth cohort has a higher prevalence of pain at each age—a result not found for those with a bachelor’s degree. Thus, the gap in pain between the more and less educated has widened in each successive birth cohort. The increase seen across birth cohorts cannot be explained by changes in occupation or levels of obesity for the less educated, but fits a more general pattern seen in the ongoing erosion of working-class life for those born after 1950. If these patterns continue, pain prevalence will continue to increase for all adults; importantly, tomorrow’s elderly will be sicker than today’s elderly, with potentially serious implications for healthcare.},

In this study, we examine the impact of automation on age- and sex-specific mortality. Using exogenous variation in automation to support causal inference, we find that increases in automation over the period 1993–2007 led to substantive increases in all-cause mortality for both men and women aged 45–54. Disaggregating by cause, we find evidence that automation is associated with increases in drug overdose deaths, suicide, homicide, and cardiovascular mortality, although patterns differ by age and sex. We further examine heterogeneity in effects by safety net program generosity, labor market policies, and the supply of prescription opioids.},

	abstract = {This study addresses two questions. First, why do Black Americans exhibit worse health outcomes than White Americans even at higher levels of socioeconomic status (SES)? Second, are diminished health returns to higher status concentrated among Black Americans with darker skin color? Novel hypotheses are tested with biosocial panel data from Add Health, a nationally representative cohort of Black and White adolescents who have transitioned to adulthood. We find that White and light-skin Black respondents report improved health after achieving higher SES, on average, while their darker-skin Black peers report declining health. These patterns persist regardless of controls for adolescent health status and unmeasured between-person heterogeneity. Moreover, increased inflammation tied to unfair treatment and perceptions of lower status helps to account for patterns of diminished health returns for dark-skin Black groups. Our study is the first to document skin tone heterogeneity in diminished health returns and one of few studies to identify life course stress processes underlying such disparities. We consider additional processes that could be examined in future studies, as well as the broader health and policy implications of our findings.},

We find that African American men and women, American Indian/Alaska Native men and women, and Latino men face higher lifetime risk of being killed by police than do their white peers. We find that Latina women and Asian/Pacific Islander men and women face lower risk of being killed by police than do their white peers. Risk is highest for black men, who (at current levels of risk) face about a 1 in 1,000 chance of being killed by police over the life course. The average lifetime odds of being killed by police are about 1 in 2,000 for men and about 1 in 33,000 for women. Risk peaks between the ages of 20 y and 35 y for all groups.

Access helps determine whether the individual makes contact with the family planning provider, while quality of care greatly affects the client's decision to accept a method and the motivation to continue using it. Medical barriers are scientifically unjustifiable policies or practices, based at least in part on a medical rationale, that inappropriately prevent clients from receiving the contraceptive method of their choice or impose unnecessary process barriers to access to family planning services. In the past, international family planning efforts have been criticized as placing too much emphasis on issues of access and the quantity of contraceptives distributed.

	abstract = {Background
Analyzing Body Mass Index as a didactical example, the study by Evans, Williams, Onnela, and Subramanian (EWOS study) introduce a novel methodology for the investigation of socioeconomic disparities in health. By using multilevel analysis to model health inequalities within and between strata defined by the intersection of multiple social and demographic dimensions, the authors provide a better understanding of the health heterogeneity existing in the population. Their innovative methodology allows for gathering inductive information on a large number of stratum-specific interactions of effects and, simultaneously, informs on the discriminatory accuracy of such strata for predicting individual health. Their study provides an excellent answer to the call for suitable quantitative methodologies within the intersectionality framework.
Rationale
The EWOS study is a well-written tutorial; thus, in this commentary, I will not repeat the explanation of the statistical/epidemiological concepts. Instead, I will share with the reader a number of thoughts on the theoretical consequences derived from the application of multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (MAIHDA) in (social) epidemiology in general, and within the intersectional framework in particular. MAIHDA is a reorganization of concepts that allows for a better understanding of the distribution and determinants of individual health and disease risk in the population.
Conclusions
By applying MAIHD within an intersectional framework, the EWOS study provides a superior theoretical and quantitative instrument for documenting health disparities and it should become the new gold standard for investigating health disparities in (social) epidemiology. This approach is more appropriate for eco-social perspectives than the habitual probabilistic strategy based on differences between group average risks. However, both, the translation of intersectionality theory into (social) epidemiology and the intersectional quantitative methodology (especially for generalized linear models) are still under development.},

We then assess the extent to which the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)—a widely used data source for FP programs and research—has information to measure these elements. We finally examine barriers to access by element, using the latest DHS data from four countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We discuss opportunities and limitations in the measurement of access, the importance of careful interpretation of data from population-based surveys, and recommendations for collecting and using data to better measure access.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.contraception.2016.03.011},
	abstract = {Background
While most unintended pregnancies occur because couples do not use contraception, contraceptive failure is also an important underlying cause. However, few recent studies outside of the United States have estimated contraceptive failure rates, and most such studies have been restricted to married women, to a limited number of countries and to 12-month failure rate estimates.
Methods
Using self-reported data from 43 countries with Demographic and Health Survey data, we estimated typical-use contraceptive failure rates for seven contraceptive methods at 12, 24 and 36months of use. We provide a median estimate for each method across 43 countries overall, in seven subregions and in individual countries. We assess differences by various demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Estimates are not corrected for potential errors in retrospective reporting contraceptive use or potential underreporting of abortion, which may vary by country and subgroups within countries.
Results
Across all included countries, reported 12-month typical-use failure rates were lowest for users of longer-acting methods such as implants (0.6 failures per 100 episodes of use), intrauterine devices (1.4) and injectables (1.7); intermediate for users of short-term resupply methods such as oral contraceptive pills (5.5) and male condoms (5.4); and highest for users of traditional methods such as withdrawal (13.4) or periodic abstinence (13.9), a group largely using calendar rhythm.
Conclusions
Our findings help us to highlight those methods, subregions and population groups that may be in need of particular attention for improvements in policies and programs to address higher contraceptive failure rates.},

To some authors "access" refers to entry into or use of the health care system, while to others it characterizes factors influencing entry or use. The purpose of this article is to propose a taxonomic definition of "access." Access is presented here as a general concept that summarizes a set of more specific dimensions describing the fit between the patient and the health care system. The specific dimensions are availability, accessibility, accommodation, affordability and acceptability. Using interview data on patient satisfaction, the discriminant validity of these dimensions is investigated. Results provide strong support for the view that differentiation does exist among the five areas and that the measures do relate to the phenomena with which they are identified.},

These dimensions are independent yet interconnected and each is important to assess the achievement of access. However, I argue that one dimension is missing – awareness.

This paper describes how gridded population data might instead be used as a sample frame, and introduces the R GridSample algorithm for selecting primary sampling units (PSU) for complex household surveys with gridded population data. With a gridded population dataset and geographic boundary of the study area, GridSample allows a two-step process to sample “seed” cells with probability proportionate to estimated population size, then “grows” PSUs until a minimum population is achieved in each PSU. The algorithm permits stratification and oversampling of urban or rural areas. The approximately uniform size and shape of grid cells allows for spatial oversampling, not possible in typical surveys, possibly improving small area estimates with survey results.},

	abstract = {In many low and middle-income countries patients often bypass the nearest government health center offering free or subsidized services and seek more expensive care elsewhere. This study examines the role of quality of care, in particular clinician competence and structural quality of the health center, on bypassing behavior. Data for this study comes from a survey of 136 primary health centers (PHCs) and 3517 individuals living in the PHC's immediate vicinity in rural Chhattisgarh, India. Overall, the majority (67\%) of patients bypassed the local PHC when seeking treatment. Bypassing decreased as provider competence increased, up to a point, after which, improvements in competency did not reduce bypassing. The clinical competence of the health care provider had a greater effect on reducing bypassing compared to PHC structural quality such as the building condition and drug stock-outs. However, the regular presence of clinical providers in the PHC was associated with lower bypassing. Patients that visited the local PHC spent half as much out-of-pocket as those that were treated at private clinics. Poor patients were less likely to bypass the local PHC compared to non-poor patients. These findings suggest that improving structural quality is not sufficient to reduce bypassing of PHCs. While better provider competency can substantially reduce bypassing, beyond a threshold competency level there is little effect. Efforts to strengthen facility-based primary care services need to go beyond simply focusing on improving infrastructure or quality of clinical care. There is a need to rethink how PHCs can be made more relevant to the health care needs of the communities they serve.},

	abstract = {Objectives Skilled birth attendance is the single most important intervention to reduce maternal mortality. However, studies have not used routinely collected health service birth data at named health facilities to understand the influence of distance and quality of care on childbirth service utilisation. Thus, this paper aims to quantify the influence of distance and quality of healthcare on utilisation of birthing services using routine health data in Eastern Region, Ghana.
Methods We used a spatial interaction model (a model that predicts movement from one place to another) drawing on routine birth data, emergency obstetric care surveys, gridded estimates of number of pregnancies and health facility location. We compared travel distances by sociodemographic characteristics and mapped movement patterns.
Results A kilometre increase in distance significantly reduced the prevalence rate of the number of women giving birth in health facilities by 6.7\%. Although quality care increased the number of women giving birth in health facilities, its association was insignificant. Women travelled further than expected to give birth at facilities, on average journeying 4.7 km beyond the nearest facility with a recorded birth. Women in rural areas travelled 4 km more than urban women to reach a hospital. We also observed that 56\% of women bypassed the nearest hospital to their community.
Conclusion This analysis provides substantial opportunities for health planners and managers to understand further patterns of skilled birth service utilisation, and demonstrates the value of routine health data. Also, it provides evidence-based information for improving maternal health service provision by targeting specific communities and health facilities.},

	abstract = {Background: Child and maternal mortality remain high in many developing countries. A principal strategy used in low- and middle-income countries is increasing the proportion of pregnancies delivered at facilities. Although this strategy is reasonable with high quality facilities, evidence for the protective effects of facility deliveries is mixed. Methods: We pooled 1.47 million birth records collected by the Demographic and Health Surveys to estimate the association between institutional deliveries and early neonatal mortality. Subsample analysis and instrumental variable estimation were used to assess and correct the extent to which mortality differentials are biased by an increased likelihood of facility attendance for high-risk deliveries. Results: No associations between institutional deliveries and early neonatal mortality were found in the pooled sample [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.995, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.966-1.025)]. When stratified by facility type, protective effects were found for private facilities (aOR 0.876, 95\% CI 0.840-0.914), but not for public hospitals or health centres. Significant protective effects were found when past behaviour was used to eliminate selection bias generated by short-term responses to medical need (aOR 0.884, 95\% CI 0.814-0.961). At the community and country levels, strong positive associations were found between early neonatal mortality among facility deliveries and the prevalence of institutional deliveries. Conclusion: Facility deliveries have the potential to reduce early neonatal mortality in developing countries. The results presented suggest that the quality, utilization and protective effects of institutional deliveries vary widely across countries; major improvements in both utilization and quality of care will be needed to achieve further improvements in maternal and child health.},

These studies have also highlighted the problems of causality that are typically not taken into account when estimating the effects of antenatal care on skilled birth attendance. In this study, we revisit this relation in the rural areas of four countries: Ghana, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Using a structural equation modeling approach that corrects for endogeneity, in all four countries we find that the usual simpler probit (or logit) models tend to underestimate the direct effect of antenatal care on skilled birth attendance. Furthermore, in two of the countries, this estimated effect is mediated by the range of services offered to women during antenatal care. These results suggest that governments and NGOs should place more importance on the role of antenatal care providers and on the services they offer, in efforts to promote skilled birth attendance.},

We find that the simple measure of self-assessed health and self-reported measures of functional ability and disability are the strongest predictors in all demographic groups, and are generally ranked considerably higher than biomarkers. Among the biomarkers, serum albumin is highly ranked in most demographic groups, whereas clinical measures of cardiovascular and metabolic function are consistently among the weakest predictors.

We propose a novel and timely lifespan variation measure, which we call the cross-sectional average inequality in lifespan, or CAL†. This new index provides an alternative perspective on the analysis of lifespan inequality by combining the mortality histories of all cohorts present in a cross-sectional approach. We demonstrate how differences in the CAL† measure can be decomposed between populations by age and cohort to explore the compression or expansion of mortality in a cohort perspective. We apply these new methods using data from 10 low-mortality countries or regions from 1879 to 2013. CAL† reveals greater uncertainty in the timing of death than the period life table–based indices of variation indicate. Also, country rankings of lifespan inequality vary considerably between period and cross-sectional measures. These differences raise intriguing questions as to which temporal dimension is the most relevant to individuals when considering the uncertainty in the timing of death in planning their life courses.},

We therefore have developed the Subnational Human Development Index (SHDI), which shows within-country variation in human development across the globe. Covering more than 1,600 regions within 161 countries, the SHDI and its underlying dimension indices provide a 10 times higher resolution picture of human development than previously available. The newly observed within-country variation is particularly strong in low- and middle-developed countries. Education disparities explain most SHDI inequality within low-developed countries, and standard of living differences are most important within the more highly developed ones. Strong convergence forces operating both across and within countries have compensated the inequality enhancing force of population growth. These changes will shape the twenty-first century agenda of scientists and policy-makers concerned with global distributive justice.},

This article reports on changes in life expectancies around the world as far as they can be estimated from the evidence available at the end of 2021. The global life expectancy appears to have declined by 0.92 years between 2019 and 2020 and by another 0.72 years between 2020 and 2021, but the decline seems to have ended during the last quarter of 2021. Uncertainty about its exact size aside, this represents the first decline in global life expectancy since 1950, the first year for which a global estimate is available from the United Nations. Annual declines in life expectancy (from a 12-month period to the next) appear to have exceeded two years at some point before the end of 2021 in at least 50 countries. Since 1950, annual declines of that magnitude had only been observed on rare occasions, such as Cambodia in the 1970s, Rwanda in the 1990s, and possibly some sub-Saharan African nations at the peak of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic.},

The surveys were selected to reflect diverse topics and foci; and provide an insight into analytic approaches across research themes. The search identified 159 articles appropriate for full text review and data extraction.Results:The analyses adopted in the multi-country surveys can be broadly classified as: univariate/bivariate analyses, and multivariate/multivariable analyses. Multivariate/multivariable analyses may be further divided into design- and model-based analyses. Of the 159 articles reviewed, 129 articles used model-based analysis, 30 articles used design-based analyses. Similar patterns could be seen in all the individual surveys.Conclusion:While there is general agreement among survey statisticians that complex surveys are most appropriately analyzed using design-based analyses, most researchers continued to use the more common model-based approaches. Recent developments in design-based multi-level analysis may be one approach to include all the survey design characteristics. This is a relatively new area, however, and there remains statistical, as well as applied analytic research required. An important limitation of this study relates to the selection of the surveys used and the choice of year for the analysis, i.e., year 2010 only. There is, however, no strong reason to believe that analytic strategies have changed radically in the past few years, and 2010 provides a credible snapshot of current practice.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Despite the pervasiveness of child marriage and its potentially adverse consequences on reproductive health outcomes, there is relatively little empirical evidence available on this issue, which has hindered efforts to improve the targeting of adolescent health programs. The purpose of this study was to assess the association of child marriage with fertility, fertility control, and maternal health care use outcomes in four South Asian countries: India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan.
Methods
Data for the study come from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in the study countries; we used a subsample of women aged 20–24 years. Child marriage, defined as first marriage before 18 years of age, is categorized into two groups: first married at ages 15–17 years and first married at age ≤14 years. We used multivariate logistic regression models.
Results
The results of the study suggest that child marriage is significantly associated with a history of rapid repeat childbirth, current modern contraceptive use, female sterilization, not using contraception before first childbirth, pregnancy termination, unintended pregnancy, and inadequate use of maternal health services, although the associations are not always consistent across countries. Furthermore, women who married in early adolescence or childhood show a higher propensity toward most of the negative outcomes, compared with women who married in middle adolescence.
Conclusions
Child marriage adds a layer of vulnerability to women that leads to poor fertility control and fertility-related outcomes, and low maternal health care use.},

	abstract = {Background: Access to health facilities remains limited in many resource-poor settings, and women and their children often have to travel far to seek care. However, data on distance are scarce, and it is unclear whether distance is associated with worse child health outcomes. We estimate the relationships between distance to facility, service utilization and child mortality in low- and middle-income countries.Methods: Population-representative data are pooled from 29 demographic and health surveys across 21 low- and middle-income countries. Multivariable logistic models and meta-analysis regressions are used to estimate associations between facility distance, child mortality, and health care utilization in the pooled sample as well as for each survey.Results: Compared with children who live within 1 km of a facility, children living within 2 km, 3 km, and 5 km of a facility have a 7.7\% [95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.927 – 1.251], 16.3\% (95\% CI: 1.020 – 1.327) and 25\% (95\% CI: 1.087 – 1.439) higher odds of neonatal mortality, respectively; children living farther than 10 km have a 26.6\% (95\% CI: 1.108 – 1.445) higher odds of neonatal mortality. Women living farther than 10 km from a facility have a 55.3\% lower odds of in-facility delivery compared with women who live within 1 km [odds ratio (OR): 0.447; 95\% CI: 0.394 – 0.508].Conclusions: Even relatively small distances from health facilities are associated with substantial mortality penalties for children. Policies that reduce travel distances and travel times are likely to increase utilization of health services and reduce neonatal mortality.},

	abstract = {Background. The health care a woman receives during pregnancy is important for her survival and baby, both at the time of delivery and shortly after that. In the context of high maternal morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, fewer than 80\% of pregnant women receive antenatal care visit services. Receiving antenatal care visits at least four times increases the likelihood of receiving effective maternal health interventions through the antenatal period. This study aimed to identify the utilization and determinants of attending at least four visits in 12 East African countries. Methods. The study used the demographic and health survey data from 12 East African countries from 2008 to 2018. The DHS program adopts standardized methods involving uniform questionnaires, manuals, and field procedures to gather information comparable across countries globally. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to identify the determinants of completing at least four antenatal care services. With their 95\% CI obtained from the adjusted multilevel logistic regression model, the adjusted odds ratio was presented to show the magnitude of the relationship between the independent variable and completing antenatal care visits. Results. The pooled utilization of attending at least four antenatal care visit in the East African region was 52.44\% (95\% CI: 52.13, 52.74), with the highest attending at least four or more antenatal care visit visits in Zimbabwe (75.72\%) and the lowest attending at least four or more antenatal care visit visits in Ethiopia (31.82\%). The significant determinants of completing at least four ANC visits were age category (24–34 (AOR = 1.24, 95\% CI: 1.18, 1.31) and 35–49 (AOR = 1.42, 95\% CI: 1.32, 1.53)); being married women (AOR = 1.11, 95\% CI: 1.1.05, 1.16); education levels of primary education (AOR = 1.20, 95\% CI: 1.13, 1.27), secondary education (AOR = 1.24, 95\% CI: 1.24, 1.47), and higher education (AOR = 1.91, 95\% CI: 1.62, 2.14); birth order (2–4 (AOR = 0.75, 95\% CI: 0.70, 0.79) and 5+ (AOR = 0.63, 95\% CI: 0.58, 0.68)); planned pregnancy (AOR = 0.81, 95\% CI: 0.75, 0.86); contraceptive utilization (AOR = 1.36, 95\% CI: 1.29, 1.43); wealth status of middle (AOR = 1.11, 95\% CI: 1.05, 1.17) and rich (AOR = 1.25, 95\% CI: 1.18, 1.32); having no problem accessing health care (AOR = 1.0.95, 95\% CI: 0.89, 0.97); and living countries. Conclusions. The coverage of completing the recommended antenatal care visit was low in the region. Age, marital status, mother’s and partner’s education, women’s occupation, birth order, planned pregnancy, contraceptive utilization, wealth status, healthcare accessibility, and living countries were the major determinants of completing recommended antenatal care visits. Therefore, intersectoral collaboration to promote female education and empowerment, improve geographical access to health care, and strengthen implementation of antenatal care policies with active community participation is recommended. In addition, creating a conducive environment in entrepreneurial activities for poor women is needed.},

	abstract = {Objectives To assess whether the joint effects of water and sanitation infrastructure, are acting antagonistically (redundant services preventing the same cases of diarrhoeal disease), independently, or synergistically; and to assess how these effects vary by country and over time. Methods We used data from 217 Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 74 countries between 1986 and 2013. We used modified Poisson regression to assess the impact of water and sanitation infrastructure on the prevalence of diarrhoea among children under 5. Results The impact of water and sanitation varied across surveys, and adjusting for socio-economic status drove these estimates towards the null. Sanitation had a greater effect than water infrastructure when all 217 surveys were pooled; however, the impact of sanitation diminished over time. Based on survey data from the past 10 years, we saw no evidence for benefits in improving drinking water or sanitation alone, but we estimated a 6\% reduction of both combined (prevalence ratio = 0.94, 95\% confidence limit 0.91–0.98). Conclusions Water and sanitation interventions should be combined to maximise the number of cases of diarrhoeal disease prevented in children under 5. Further research should identify the sources of variability seen between countries and across time. These national surveys likely include substantial measurement error in the categorisation of water and sanitation, making it difficult to interpret the roles of other pathways.},

Methods We pooled data from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 30 African countries between 2006 and 2015. We described the extent of mistimed and unwanted pregnancies and further used mixed effects logistic and Poisson regression estimation techniques to examine the impacts of planned, mistimed and unwanted pregnancies on the use of prenatal health services. Results In total, 73.65\% of pregnancies in all countries were planned. Mistimed pregnancy ranged from 7.43\% in Burkina Faso to 41.33\% in Namibia. Unwanted pregnancies were most common in Swaziland (39.54\%) and least common in Niger (0.74\%). Timely (first trimester) initiation of ANC was 37\% overall in all countries; the multicountry average number of ANC visits was optimal [4.1; 95\% CI: 4.1–4.2] but with notable disparities between countries. Overall, mistimed and unwanted pregnancies were strongly associated with late ANC attendance and fewer visits women made in the pooled analysis. Conclusions Unintended pregnancies are critical risks to achieving improved maternal health in respect of early and optimal ANC coverage for women in Africa. Programmes targeted at advancing coverage of ANC in Africa need to deploy contextually appropriate mechanisms to prevent unintended pregnancies.},

	abstract = {Background The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 aims at reducing neonatal and under-5 mortality to below 12 per 1000 and 25 per 1000 live births, respectively, globally by 2030. Studies have found that initiation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth and continuous breastfeeding for over 12 months can positively impact neonatal and infant health. However, there is evidence that the sex of a child may influence the breastfeeding practices of a mother. Thus, we examined sex inequality in early breastfeeding initiation in sub-Saharan Africa. Materials and methods Data from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 24 sub-Saharan African countries between January 2010 and December 2019 were pooled and analysed. A total of 137,677 women of reproductive age (15–49 years) were considered in this study. Bivariate and multivariable regression analyses were performed, and the results were presented using crude odds ratio (cOR) and adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with statistical significance at a p-value less than 0.05. Results The highest inequality in early initiation of breastfeeding was reported in Togo with a difference of 5.21\% between the female and male children, while the lowest inequality was reported in Guinea with 0.48\% difference between the female and male children. A higher odds of breastfeeding within 1 hour was observed among female children [cOR = 1.05; 95\%(CI = 1.02–1.09)] compared to male children, and this persisted after controlling for the confounders included in this study [aOR = 1.05; 95\%(CI = 1.02–1.08)]. Conclusion We found higher odds for early breastfeeding initiation of female children compared to male children in sub-Saharan Africa. To reduce breastfeeding initiation inequalities, programmes that educate and encourage early initiation of breastfeeding irrespective of the child sex should be promoted among mothers.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Sexual violence plays a key role in women's pregnancy intention. We investigated the influence of sexual violence on planned, mistimed, and unwanted pregnancies in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
Materials and methods
Data from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) of 22 countries in SSA were used in this study. Both descriptive and inferential analyses were conducted. We carried out a multinomial logistic regression analysis to examine the effect of sexual violence on planned, mistimed, and unwanted pregnancies. STATA version 14.2 was used to carry out all analyses. Statistical significance was declared at p{\textless}0.05.
Results
At the descriptive level, we found that 74.1\% of women of reproductive age in SSA had planned pregnancies, with the remaining 25.9\% having either mistimed (20.4\%) or unwanted (5.5\%) pregnancies. Women in Nigeria had the lowest proportion of mistimed pregnancies (7.5\%) whereas those in Burundi had the greatest percentage of unwanted pregnancies (12.4\%). Women who had history of sexual violence had increased risk of mistimed [ARRR = 1.5, CI = 1.3–1.7] and unwanted pregnancies [ARRR = 1.6, CI = 1.3–2.0], compared to those with no history of sexual violence. Women aged 40–44 [ARRR = 3.3, CI = 1.4–7.6] and 45–49 [ARRR = 4.4, CI = 1.7–11.2] had higher risk of unwanted pregnancies, compared to women aged 15–19. Women who were cohabiting had higher risk of mistimed [ARRR = 1.3, CI = 1.1–1.4] and unwanted pregnancies [ARRR = 1.6, CI = 1.3–2.1], compared to married women.
Conclusion
Sexual violence plays a key role in mistimed and unwanted pregnancies. It is, therefore, prudent to develop various assessment techniques to detect sexual violence in unions and refer victims to appropriate services to diminish the risk of mistimed and unwanted pregnancies. Our findings provide a basis for developing and implementing policies and interventions aimed at reducing mistimed and unwanted pregnancies.},

	abstract = {Background According to the 2017 estimate, around 214 million reproductive-age women in developing regions who want to avoid pregnancy do not use a modern contraceptive method. Although there are studies done on factors associated with modern contraceptive utilization in individual East African countries, as to our search of the literature, there is limited evidence on the pooled prevalence and determinants of modern contraceptive utilization in the East African region. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence and determinants of modern contraceptive utilization in the East African region. Methods The pooled prevalence of modern contraceptive utilization and the strength of determinants were estimated using STATA version 14. Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC), Median Odds Ratio (MOR), Proportional Change in Variance (PCV), and deviance were used for model fitness and comparison. The multilevel logistic regression model was fitted to identify determinants of modern contraceptive use in the region. Adjusted Odds Ratio with its 95\% Confidence Interval was presented, and variables with a p-value ≤of 0.05 were declared significant determinants of modern contraceptive utilization. Results Overall, about 20.68\% (95\%CI:-20.46.,20.91)of women used modern contraceptive, ranging from 9.08\% in Mozambique to 61.49\% in Comoros. In the multilevel logistic regression model; maternal age group 25–34 (AOR: 0.79, 95\%CI:0.76,0.82) and 35–49 (AOR:0.49, 95\%CI:0.46,0.51). Being married (AOR:0.85, 95\%CI:0.82,0.88), mothers with primary education (AOR:1.48, 95\%CI:1.43,1.54) and secondary and above education level (AOR:1.60, 95\%CI:1.52,1.69), husbands with primary education (AOR:2.43, 95\%CI:2.35,2.51) and secondary and above education level (AOR:2.92, 95\%CI:2.76,3.05). The mothers who had occupation (AOR:2.11, 95\%CI:1.23,1.33), mothers from households with middle wealth index (AOR:1.23, 95\%CI:1.19,1.28) and rich wealth index (AOR:1.28, 95\%CI:1.23,1.33) were found to be significant determinants of modern contraceptive use. Conclusion We found that modern contraceptive utilization in the 12 East Africa countries was low compared to SDG target 2030(75\%). The governmental and non-governmental organizations should scale up their public health programs to the poor and marginalized communities to scale up modern contraceptive utilization uptake in the region. In addition, reforming the health system and reproductive health education through mass media to create awareness of modern contraceptive use benefits are effective strategies to improve modern contraceptive use among East Africa women.},

	abstract = {Background There is mixed evidence and lack of consensus on the impact of economic development on stunting, and likewise there is a dearth of empirical studies on this relationship in the case of sub-Saharan Africa. Thus, this paper examines whether economic growth is associated with childhood stunting in low-income and middle-income sub-Saharan African countries.
Methods We analysed data from 89 Demographic and Health Surveys conducted between 1987 and 2016 available as of October 2018 using multivariable multilevel logistic regression models to show the association between gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and stunting. We adjusted the models for child’s age, survey year, child’s sex, birth order and country random effect, and presented adjusted and unadjusted ORs.
Results We included data from 490 526 children. We found that the prevalence of stunting decreased with increasing GDP per capita (correlation coefficient=−0.606, p{\textless}0.0001). In the unadjusted model for full sample, for every US\$1000 increase in GDP per capita, the odds of stunting decreased by 23\% (OR=0.77, 95\% CI 0.76 to 0.78). The magnitude of the association between GDP per capita and stunting was stronger among children in the richest quintile. After adjustment was made, the association was not significant among children from the poorest quintile. However, the magnitude of the association was more pronounced among children from low-income countries, such that, in the model adjusted for child’s age, survey year, child’s sex, birth order and country random effect, the association between GDP per capita and stunting remained statistically significant; for every US\$1000 increase in GDP per capita, the odds of stunting decreased by 12\% (OR=0.88, 95\% CI 0.87 to 0.90).
Conclusion There was no significant association between economic growth and child nutritional status. The prevalence of stunting decreased with increasing GDP per capita. This was more pronounced among children from the richest quintile. The magnitude of the association was higher among children from low-income countries, suggesting that households in the poorest quintile were typically the least likely to benefit from economic gains. The findings could serve as a building block needed to modify current policy as per child nutrition-related programmes in Africa.},

Age, marital status, mother’s and partner’s education, women’s occupation, birth order, planned pregnancy, contraceptive utilization, wealth status, healthcare accessibility, and living countries were the major determinants of completing recommended antenatal care visits. Therefore, intersectoral collaboration to promote female education and empowerment, improve geographical access to health care, and strengthen implementation of antenatal care policies with active community participation is recommended. In addition, creating a conducive environment in entrepreneurial activities for poor women is needed.},

	abstract = {Introduction Approximately 14 million unintended pregnancies are recorded annually in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We sought to investigate the prevalence and determinants of unintended pregnancies among women in sub-Saharan Africa. Materials and methods The study pooled data from current Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2016 from 29 countries in SSA. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the factors that influence unintended pregnancies in SSA. Results were presented using odds ratios (OR). Results We found overall unintended pregnancy prevalence rate of 29\%, ranging from 10.8\% in Nigeria to 54.5\% in Namibia. As compared to women aged 15–19 years, women of all other age categories had higher odds of unintended pregnancies. Married women were 6 times more probable to report unintended pregnancy as compared to women who had never married (OR = 6.29, CI = 5.65–7.01). The phenomenon had higher odds among rural residents as compared to urban residents (OR = 1.08, CI = 1.01–1.16). Women with primary (OR = 0.74, CI = 0.69–0.80) and secondary (OR = 0.71, CI = 0.65–0.77) levels of education had less chances of unintended pregnancies, compared to those with no education. Again, women in all other wealth categories had less probability of unintended pregnancy, as compared to women with poorest wealth status. Conclusion Our study contributes substantially towards the discourse of maternal wellbeing by unveiling the prevalence and determinants of unintended pregnancy across the SSA region. There is the need for SSA countries with high prevalence of unintended pregnancies to consider past and present successful interventions of other countries within the region such as health education, counselling, skills-building, comprehensive sex education and access to contraception. Much of these efforts rest with the governments of SSA countries.},

Each birth cohort acquires coherence and continuity from the distinctive development of its constituents and from its own persistent macroanalytic features. Successive cohorts are differentiated by the changing content of formal education, by peer-group socialization, and by idiosyncratic historical experience. Young adults are prominent in war, revolution, immigration, urbanization and technological change. Since cohorts are used to achieve structural transformation and since they manifest its consequences in characteristic ways, it is proposed that research be designed to capitalize on the congruence of social change and cohort identification.},

	abstract = {Many standard philosophical accounts of scientific practice fail to distinguish between modeling and other types of theory construction. This failure is unfortunate because there are important contrasts among the goals, procedures, and representations employed by modelers and other kinds of theorists. We can see some of these differences intuitively when we reflect on the methods of theorists such as Vito Volterra and Linus Pauling on the one hand, and Charles Darwin and Dimitri Mendeleev on the other. Much of Volterra's and Pauling's work involved modeling; much of Darwin's and Mendeleev's did not. In order to capture this distinction, I consider two examples of theory construction in detail: Volterra's treatment of post-WWI fishery dynamics and Mendeleev's construction of the periodic system. I argue that modeling can be distinguished from other forms of theorizing by the procedures modelers use to represent and to study real-world phenomena: indirect representation and analysis. This differentiation between modelers and non-modelers is one component of the larger project of understanding the practice of modeling, its distinctive features, and the strategies of abstraction and idealization it employs.

	abstract = {Environmental computer models are considered essential tools in supporting environmental decision making, but their main value is that they allow a better understanding of our complex environment. Environmental models are in fact applications of shared theories on how real-world systems are functioning. Just like the underlying scientific theories they need to be evaluated and discussed among peers. To allow proper assessment of the quality and suitability of environmental models peers should be able to trace their results and insights through the model structure to the underlying choices and assumptions. This ideal of model evaluation should take place in the peer-review process before their output and the analysis of their output are published in scientific journals, but is hardly ever realized in reality. It is hypothesized that, despite the numerous attempts to promote good modeling practice and extended peer review, the reproducibility and transparency of environmental models is limited in actual terms. To test the validity of this hypothesis we have reviewed publications, documentation and software of four environmental models. We analyzed to what extent this material provided insight in the model structure and the modeling process and to what extent model findings could be traced back to the underlying choices and assumptions.},

	abstract = {A ground-up approach to explaining dynamic spatial modelling for an interdisciplinary audience. Across broad areas of the environmental and social sciences, simulation models are an important way to study systems inaccessible to scientific experimental and observational methods, and also an essential complement to those more conventional approaches. The contemporary research literature is teeming with abstract simulation models whose presentation is mathematically demanding and requires a high level of knowledge of quantitative and computational methods and approaches. Furthermore, simulation models designed to represent specific systems and phenomena are often complicated, and, as a result, difficult to reconstruct from their descriptions in the literature. This book aims to provide a practical and accessible account of dynamic spatial modelling, while also equipping readers with a sound conceptual foundation in the subject, and a useful introduction to the wide-ranging literature. Spatial Simulation: Exploring Pattern and Process is organised around the idea that a small number of spatial processes underlie the wide variety of dynamic spatial models. Its central focus on three ‘building-blocks’ of dynamic spatial models – forces of attraction and segregation, individual mobile entities, and processes of spread – guides the reader to an understanding of the basis of many of the complicated models found in the research literature. The three building block models are presented in their simplest form and are progressively elaborated and related to real world process that can be represented using them. Introductory chapters cover essential background topics, particularly the relationships between pattern, process and spatiotemporal scale. Additional chapters consider how time and space can be represented in more complicated models, and methods for the analysis and evaluation of models. Finally, the three building block models are woven together in a more elaborate example to show how a complicated model can be assembled from relatively simple components. To aid understanding, more than 50 specific models described in the book are available online at patternandprocess.org for exploration in the freely available Netlogo platform. This book encourages readers to develop intuition for the abstract types of model that are likely to be appropriate for application in any specific context. Spatial Simulation: Exploring Pattern and Process will be of interest to undergraduate and graduate students taking courses in environmental, social, ecological and geographical disciplines. Researchers and professionals who require a non-specialist introduction will also find this book an invaluable guide to dynamic spatial simulation.},

As a strategy for the future, we propose a standard format for documenting models and their analyses: transparent and comprehensive ecological modeling (TRACE) documentation. This standard format will disclose all parts of the modeling process to scrutiny and make modeling itself more efficient and coherent.},

	abstract = {Ecological risk assessments of pesticides usually focus on risk at the level of individuals, and are carried out by comparing exposure and toxicological endpoints. However, in most cases the protection goal is populations rather than individuals. On the population level, effects of pesticides depend not only on exposure and toxicity, but also on factors such as life history characteristics, population structure, timing of application, presence of refuges in time and space, and landscape structure. Ecological models can integrate such factors and have the potential to become important tools for the prediction of population-level effects of exposure to pesticides, thus allowing extrapolations, for example, from laboratory to field. Indeed, a broad range of ecological models have been applied to chemical risk assessment in the scientific literature, but so far such models have only rarely been used to support regulatory risk assessments of pesticides. To better understand the reasons for this situation, the current modeling practice in this field was assessed in the present study. The scientific literature was searched for relevant models and assessed according to nine characteristics: model type, model complexity, toxicity measure, exposure pattern, other factors, taxonomic group, risk assessment endpoint, parameterization, and model evaluation. The present study found that, although most models were of a high scientific standard, many of them would need modification before they are suitable for regulatory risk assessments. The main shortcomings of currently available models in the context of regulatory pesticide risk assessments were identified. When ecological models are applied to regulatory risk assessments, we recommend reviewing these models according to the nine characteristics evaluated here. Environ. Toxicol.

They are incorporating an ever broader range of disciplines and now often confront people without strong quantitative or model-building backgrounds. These trends imply a need for wider awareness of what constitutes good model-development practice, including reporting of models to users and sceptical review of models by users. To this end the paper outlines ten basic steps of good, disciplined model practice. The aim is to develop purposeful, credible models from data and prior knowledge, in consort with end-users, with every stage open to critical review and revision. Best practice entails identifying clearly the clients and objectives of the modelling exercise; documenting the nature (quantity, quality, limitations) of the data used to construct and test the model; providing a strong rationale for the choice of model family and features (encompassing review of alternative approaches); justifying the techniques used to calibrate the model; serious analysis, testing and discussion of model performance; and making a resultant statement of model assumptions, utility, accuracy, limitations, and scope for improvement. In natural resource management applications, these steps will be a learning process, even a partnership, between model developers, clients and other interested parties.},

	abstract = {This letter details the collective views of a number of independent researchers on the technical assessment and evaluation of environmental models and software. The purpose is to stimulate debate and initiate action that leads to an improved quality of model development and evaluation, so increasing the capacity for models to have positive outcomes from their use. As such, we emphasize the relationship between the model evaluation process and credibility with stakeholders (including funding agencies) with a view to ensure continued support for modelling efforts. Many journals, including EM\&S, publish the results of environmental modelling studies and must judge the work and the submitted papers based solely on the material that the authors have chosen to present and on how they present it. There is considerable variation in how this is done with the consequent risk of considerable variation in the quality and usefulness of the resulting publication. Part of the problem is that the review process is reactive, responding to the submitted manuscript. In this letter, we attempt to be proactive and give guidelines for researchers, authors and reviewers as to what constitutes best practice in presenting environmental modelling results. This is a unique contribution to the organisation and practice of model-based research and the communication of its results that will benefit the entire environmental modelling community. For a start, our view is that the community of environmental modellers should have a common vision of minimum standards that an environmental model must meet. A common vision of what a good model should be is expressed in various guidelines on Good Modelling Practice. The guidelines prompt modellers to codify their practice and to be more rigorous in their model testing. Our statement within this letter deals with another aspect of the issue – it prompts professional journals to codify the peer-review process. Introducing a more formalized approach to peer-review may discourage reviewers from accepting invitations to review given the additional time and labour requirements. The burden of proving model credibility is thus shifted to the authors. Here we discuss how to reduce this burden by selecting realistic evaluation criteria and conclude by advocating the use of standardized evaluation tools as this is a key issue that needs to be tackled.},

	abstract = {Mortality crises are relatively common demographic events, but we know little about how they affect local populations beyond excess mortality. I argue that using a kinship perspective to study mortality crises provides valuable insights into (1) how excess mortality affects the exposure to kin loss and (2) how family bereavement may contribute to the reproduction of historical memory in the long term. I explore these two processes using a unique genealogical database that records the complete demographic history of Rio Negro, a genocide-affected population in Guatemala, between 1982 and 2015. The analysis shows that deaths from the 1982 genocide were balanced by age, sex, and socioeconomic status. One third of the population were killed, but two thirds were left bereaved (the top 10\% most affected individuals lost 30\% of their nuclear family relatives and 23\% of their extended family relatives). Notably, the proportion of the population related to a victim did not change between 1983 and 2015. The persistence of family bereavement can be interpreted as a prolongation of grief or as a driver of historical memory. These demographic dynamics have implications for the study of historical events beyond mortality crises.},

	abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a large increase in mortality in the United States and around the world, leaving many grieving the sudden loss of family members. We created an indicator—the COVID-19 bereavement multiplier—that estimates the average number of individuals who will experience the death of a close relative (defined as a grandparent, parent, sibling, spouse, or child) for each COVID-19 death. Using demographic microsimulation-based estimates of kinship networks in the United States, the clear age gradient in COVID-19 mortality seen across contexts, and several hypothetical infection prevalence scenarios, we estimate COVID-19 bereavement multipliers for White and Black individuals in the United States. Our analysis shows that for every COVID-19 death, approximately nine surviving Americans will lose a grandparent, parent, sibling, spouse, or child. These estimates imply, for example, that if 190,000 Americans die from COVID-19, as some models project, then ∼1.7 million will experience the death of a close relative. We demonstrate that our estimates of the bereavement multiplier are stable across epidemiological realities, including infection scenarios, total number of deaths, and the distribution of deaths, which means researchers can estimate the bereavement burden over the course of the epidemic in lockstep with rising death tolls. In addition, we provide estimates of bereavement multipliers by age group, types of kin loss, and race to illuminate prospective disparities. The bereavement multiplier is a useful indicator for tracking COVID-19’s multiplicative impact as it reverberates across American families and can be tailored to other causes of death.},

	abstract = {Close kin provide many important functions as adults age, affecting health, financial well-being, and happiness. Those without kin report higher rates of loneliness and experience elevated risks of chronic illness and nursing facility placement. Historical racial differences and recent shifts in core demographic rates suggest that white and black older adults in the United States may have unequal availability of close kin and that this gap in availability will widen in the coming decades. Whereas prior work explores the changing composition and size of the childless population or those without spouses, here we consider the kinless population of older adults with no living close family members and how this burden is changing for different race and sex groups. Using demographic microsimulation and the United States Census Bureau’s recent national projections of core demographic rates by race, we examine two definitions of kinlessness: those without a partner or living children, and those without a partner, children, siblings, or parents. Our results suggest dramatic growth in the size of the kinless population as well as increasing racial disparities in percentages kinless. These conclusions are driven by declines in marriage and are robust to different assumptions about the future trajectory of divorce rates or growth in nonmarital partnerships. Our findings draw attention to the potential expansion of older adult loneliness, which is increasingly considered a threat to population health, and the unequal burden kinlessness may place on black Americans.},

We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider the age composition of local and national contexts as well as intergenerational interactions.

	abstract = {Background
Neonatal mortality rates (NMRs) in countries of low and middle income have been only slowly decreasing; coverage of essential maternal and newborn health services needs to increase, particularly for disadvantaged populations. Our aim was to produce comparable estimates of changes in socioeconomic inequalities in NMR in the past two decades across these countries.
Methods
We used data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for countries in which a survey was done in 2008 or later and one about 10 years previously. We measured absolute inequalities with the slope index of inequality and relative inequalities with the relative index of inequality. We used an asset-based wealth index and maternal education as measures of socioeconomic position and summarised inequality estimates for all included countries with random-effects meta-analysis.
Findings
24 low-income and middle-income countries were eligible for inclusion. In most countries, absolute and relative wealth-related and educational inequalities in NMR decreased between survey 1 and survey 2. In five countries (Cameroon, Nigeria, Malawi, Mozambique, and Uganda), the difference in NMR between the top and bottom of the wealth distribution was reduced by more than two neonatal deaths per 1000 livebirths per year. By contrast, wealth-related inequality increased by more than 1·5 neonatal deaths per 1000 livebirths per year in Ethiopia and Cambodia. Patterns of change in absolute and relative educational inequalities in NMR were similar to those of wealth-related NMR inequalities, although the size of educational inequalities tended to be slightly larger.
Interpretation
Socioeconomic inequality in NMR seems to have decreased in the past two decades in most countries of low and middle income. However, a substantial survival advantage remains for babies born into wealthier households with a high educational level, which should be considered in global efforts to further reduce NMR.

	abstract = {Background:
Prior work examining the association of maternal obesity and neonatal mortality indicate the presence of a positive relationship. However, regional evidence to provide insight on country-level heterogeneities within sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) with nationally representative datasets are non-existent.

Objective:
We aimed to determine the relationship between maternal obesity and neonatal mortality at the country level in SSA countries. Moreover, we also estimate regional measures of association to complement previous findings.

Methods:
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from 34 SSA countries conducted from 2006–2016 were used for this study. After missing data (36.9\% of cases) were addressed with multiple imputations, we identified a total of 175,860 women for the analysis. Complete case and multiply imputed datasets were analyzed individually with multilevel logistic regression models. Potential confounders adjusted for in the regression model included maternal age, level of educational attainment, area of residence, access to prenatal care, birth order and multiple birth (singleton vs twin birth). Regional and country-specific associations were computed, and unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs), along with the confidence intervals (CIs) were reported.

Findings:
Of the total study population, 8,451 (7.6\%) were obese. In the regional level analyses, maternal obesity was associated with 40\% increased odds of neonatal deaths. This finding was consistent in subgroup analyses by urban and rural residence, and geographic region of residence in SSA. Additionally, obese women were more likely to report neonatal death in the first week of life (OR, days 0–1: 1.39, 95\% CI 1.15–1.69; OR, days 2–6: 1.35, 95\% CI 1.02–1.79). In the individual country analyses, majority of the countries studied had central estimates supporting elevated odds of neonatal mortality, but the confidence intervals were imprecise.

Conclusion:
This study highlights the potential burden of neonatal mortality borne by obese women in SSA. There is, however, a need for longitudinal studies to confirm the results.},

METHODS: A review of all stillbirths and early newborn deaths reported in the WHO calcium supplementation trial for the prevention of pre-eclampsia conducted at seven WHO collaborating centres in Argentina, Egypt, India, Peru, South Africa and Viet Nam. We used the Baird-Pattinson system to assign primary obstetric causes of death and classified causes of early neonatal death using the International classification of diseases and related health problems, Tenth revision (ICD-10). FINDINGS: Stillbirth rate was 12.5 per 1000 births and early neonatal mortality rate was 9.0 per 1000 live births. Spontaneous preterm delivery and hypertensive disorders were the most common obstetric events leading to perinatal deaths (28.7\% and 23.6\%, respectively). Prematurity was the main cause of early neonatal deaths (62\%). CONCLUSIONS: Advancements in the care of premature infants and prevention of spontaneous preterm labour and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy could lead to a substantial decrease in perinatal mortality in hospital settings in developing countries.},

The maternal mortality ratio was 168 per 100 000 live births, ranging from 69 per 100 000 in Argentina to 316 per 100 000 in Pakistan. Overall, 29\% (98/336) of maternal deaths occurred around the time of delivery: most were attributed to haemorrhage (86/336), pre-eclampsia or eclampsia (55/336) or sepsis (39/336). Around 70\% (4349/6213) of stillbirths were probably intrapartum; 34\% (1804/5230) of neonates died on the day of delivery and 14\% (755/5230) died the day after. Stillbirths were more common in women who died than in those alive six weeks postpartum (risk ratio, RR: 9.48; 95\% confidence interval, CI: 7.97–11.27), as were perinatal deaths (RR: 4.30; 95\% CI: 3.26–5.67) and 7-day (RR: 3.94; 95\% CI: 2.74–5.65) and 28-day neonatal deaths (RR: 7.36; 95\% CI: 5.54–9.77). Conclusion Most maternal, fetal and neonatal deaths occurred at or around delivery and were attributed to preventable causes. Maternal death increased the risk of perinatal and neonatal death. Improving obstetric and neonatal care around the time of birth offers the greatest chance of reducing mortality.},

	abstract = {Globally 40 \% of deaths to children under-five occur in the very first month of life with three-quarters of these deaths occurring during the first week of life. The promotion of delivery with a skilled birth attendant (SBA) is being promoted as a strategy to reduce neonatal mortality. This study explored whether SBAs had a protective effect against neonatal mortality in three different regions of the world. The analysis pooled data from nine diverse countries for which recent Demographic and Health Survey data were available. Multilevel logistic regression was used to understand the influence of skilled delivery on two outcomes—neonatal mortality during the first week of life and during the first day of life. Control variables included age, parity, education, wealth, residence (urban/rural), geographic region (Africa, Asia and Latin America/Caribbean), antenatal care and tetanus immunization. The direction of the effect of skilled delivery on neonatal mortality was dependent on geographic region. While having a SBA at delivery was protective against neonatal mortality in Latin America/Caribbean, in Asia there was only a protective effect for births in the first week of life. In Africa SBAs were associated with higher neonatal mortality for both outcomes, and the same was true for deaths on the first day of life in Asia. Many women in Africa and Asia deliver at home unless a complication occurs, and thus skilled birth attendants may be seeing more women with complications than their unskilled counterparts. In addition there are issues with the definition of a SBA with many attendants in both Africa and Asia not actually having the needed training and equipment to prevent neonatal mortality. Considerable investment is needed in terms of training and health infrastructure to enable these providers to save the youngest lives.},

	abstract = {Background Widespread increases in facility delivery have not substantially reduced neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia over the past 2 decades. This may be due to poor quality care available in widely used primary care clinics. In this study, we examine the association between hospital delivery and neonatal mortality. Methods and findings We used an ecological study design to assess cross-sectional associations between the share of hospital delivery and neonatal mortality across country regions. Data were from the Demographic and Health Surveys from 2009 to 2018, covering 682,239 births across all regions. We assess the association between the share of facility births in a region that occurred in hospitals (versus lower-level clinics) and early (0 to 7 days) neonatal mortality per 1,000 births, controlling for potential confounders including the share of facility births, small at birth, maternal age, maternal education, urbanicity, antenatal care visits, income, region, and survey year. We examined changes in this association in different contexts of country income, global region, and urbanicity using interaction models. Across the 1,143 regions from 37 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, 42\%, 29\%, and 28\% of births took place in a hospital, clinic, and at home, respectively. A 10-percentage point higher share of facility deliveries occurring in hospitals was associated with 1.2 per 1,000 fewer deaths (p-value {\textless} 0.01; 95\% CI: 0.82 to 1.60), relative to mean mortality of 22. Associations were strongest in South Asian countries, middle-income countries, and urban regions. The study’s limitations include the inability to control for all confounding factors given the ecological and cross-sectional design and potential misclassification of facility levels in our data. Conclusions Regions with more hospital deliveries than clinic deliveries have reduced neonatal mortality. Increasing delivery in hospitals while improving quality across the health system may help to reduce high neonatal mortality.},

	abstract = {Under-five child mortality declined 47\% since 2000 following the implementation of the United Nation's (UN) Millennium Development Goals. To further reduce under-five child mortality, the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will focus on interventions to address neonatal mortality, a major contributor of under-five mortality. The African region has the highest neonatal mortality rate (28.0 per 1000 live births), followed by that of the Eastern Mediterranean (26.6) and South-East Asia (24.3). This study used the Demographic and Health Survey Birth Recode data (http://dhsprogram.com/data/File-Types-and-Names.cfm) to identify high-risk districts and countries for neonatal mortality in two sub-regions of Africa - East Africa and West Africa. Geographically weighted Poisson regression models were estimated to capture the spatially varying relationships between neonatal mortality and dimensions of potential need i) care around the time of delivery, ii) maternal education, and iii) women's empowerment. In East Africa, neonatal mortality was significantly associated with home births, mothers without an education and mothers whose husbands decided on contraceptive practices, controlling for rural residency. In West Africa, neonatal mortality was also significantly associated with home births, mothers with a primary education and mothers who did not want or plan their last child. Importantly, neonatal mortality associated with home deliveries were explained by maternal exposure to unprotected water sources in East Africa and older maternal age and female sex of infants in West Africa. Future SDG-interventions may target these dimensions of need in priority high-risk districts and countries, to further reduce the burden of neonatal mortality in Africa.},

	abstract = {Objectives Process evaluation has become the mainstay of safe motherhood evaluation in developing countries, yet the extent to which indicators measuring access to obstetric services at the population level reflect levels of maternal mortality is uncertain. In this study we examine the association between population indicators of access to obstetric care and levels of maternal mortality in urban and rural West Africa. Methods In this ecological study we used data on maternal mortality and access to obstetric services from two population-based studies conducted in 16 sites in eight West African countries: the Maternal Mortality and Obstetric Care in West Africa (MAMOCWA) study in rural Sénégal, Guinea-Bissau and The Gambia and the Morbidité Maternelle en Afrique de l'Ouest (MOMA) study in urban Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, Mauritanie, Niger and Sénégal. Results In rural areas, maternal mortality, excluding early pregnancy deaths, was 601 per 100 000 live births, compared with 241 per 100 000 for urban areas [RR = 2.49 (CI 1.77–3.59)]. In urban areas, the vast majority of births took place in a health facility (83\%) or with a skilled provider (69\%), while 80\% of the rural women gave birth at home without any skilled care. There was a relatively close link between levels of maternal mortality and the percentage of births with a skilled attendant (r = −0.65), in hospital (r = −0.54) or with a Caesarean section (r = −0.59), with marked clustering in urban and rural areas. Within urban or rural areas, none of the process indicators were associated with maternal mortality. Conclusion Despite the limitations of this ecological study, there can be little doubt that the huge rural–urban differences in maternal mortality are due, at least in part, to differential access to high quality maternity care. Whether any of the indicators examined here will by themselves be good enough as a proxy for maternal mortality is doubtful however, as more than half of the variation in mortality remained unexplained by any one of them.},

A systematic literature review identified studies documenting the factors associated with FBD, stratified by region. Rates of skilled birth attendance, facility delivery, maternal mortality, and early neonatal mortality were compared across nations and regions. 70 articles met inclusion criteria, reflecting wide variability in the number, type, and quality of studies by region. Within-country differences were most pronounced in nations where multiple studies were conducted. Correlation between FBD and maternal mortality rates throughout SSA was -0.69 (p=.008), and the correlation between facility delivery rates and early neonatal mortality rates was -0.41 (p=0.08). This study demonstrates the need to attend to regional differences both across and within SSA nations if facility delivery rates are to be improved to reduce maternal and early neonatal mortality.

	abstract = {Informal health providers ranging from drug vendors to traditional healers account for a large fraction of health care provision in developing countries. They are, however, largely unlicensed and unregulated leading to concern that they provide ineffective and, in some cases, even harmful care. A new and controversial policy tool that has been proposed to alter household health seeking behavior is an outright ban on these informal providers. The theoretical effects of such a ban are ambiguous. In this paper, we study the effect of a ban on informal (traditional) birth attendants imposed by the Malawi government in 2007. To measure the effect of the ban, we use a difference-in-difference strategy exploiting variation across time and space in the intensity of exposure to the ban. Our most conservative estimates suggest that the ban decreased use of traditional attendants by about 15 percentage points. Approximately three quarters of this decline can be attributed to an increase in use of the formal sector and the remainder is accounted for by an increase in relative/friend-attended births. Despite the rather large shift from the informal to the formal sector, we do not find any evidence of a statistically significant reduction in newborn mortality on average. The results are robust to a triple difference specification using young children as a control group. We examine several explanations for this result and find evidence consistent with quality of formal care acting as a constraint on improvements in newborn health.},

Although grief is not a disease and most people adjust without professional psychological intervention, bereavement is associated with excess risk of mortality, particularly in the early weeks and months after loss. It is related to decrements in physical health, indicated by presence of symptoms and illnesses, and use of medical services. Furthermore, bereaved individuals report diverse psychological reactions. For a few people, mental disorders or complications in the grieving process ensue. We summarise research on risk factors that increase vulnerability of some bereaved individuals. Diverse factors (circumstances of death, intrapersonal and interpersonal variables, ways of coping) are likely to co-determine excesses in ill-health. We also assess the effectiveness of psychological intervention programmes. Intervention should be targeted at high-risk people and those with complicated grief or bereavement-related depression and stress disorders.},

	abstract = {Provocative studies have reported that in the United States, marriages producing firstborn daughters are more likely to divorce than those producing firstborn sons. The findings have been interpreted as contemporary evidence of fathers’ son preference. Our study explores the potential role of another set of dynamics that may drive these patterns: namely, selection into live birth. Epidemiological evidence indicates that the characteristic female survival advantage may begin before birth. If stress accompanying unstable marriages has biological effects on fecundity, a female survival advantage could generate an association between stability and the sex composition of offspring. Combining regression and simulation techniques to analyze real-world data, we ask, How much of the observed association between sex of the firstborn child and risk of divorce could plausibly be accounted for by the joint effects of female survival advantage and reduced fecundity associated with unstable marriage? Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79), we find that relationship conflict predicts the sex of children born after conflict was measured; conflict also predicts subsequent divorce. Conservative specification of parameters linking pregnancy characteristics, selection into live birth, and divorce are sufficient to generate a selection-driven association between offspring sex and divorce, which is consequential in magnitude. Our findings illustrate the value of demographic accounting of processes which occur before birth—a period when many outcomes of central interest in the population sciences begin to take shape.},

While decompositions of HE differences account for contributions made by health and mortality, differences in HCAL are further disentangled into cohort-specific contributions. In this research note we illustrate the technique by analyzing the sex gap in health and mortality for the United States. We use the harmonized version of the Health and Retirement Survey data and define the health status in terms of activities of daily living. Our results suggest that the female advantage in cohort survival is partly compensated by women's lower cohort-specific health levels. At older ages, however, the sex differences in health are not large enough to compensate men's disadvantage in cohort survival.},

Arguing that child-bearing patterns in both kinds of societies are based on rational decisions, Caldwell concludes that, in the course of the coming century, fertility will almost certainly fall to low levels in most societies--even where economic growth has been slow and per capita incomes remain low--because of the massive social change leading to the nucleated family structure found in the West.},

Correlation analysis was used to compare the connections between discussion trends in social media messages and the temporal changes in the AQI during 2012. We categorized relevant messages into three types, retweets, mobile app messages, and original individual messages finding that original individual messages had the highest correlation to the Air Quality Index. Based on this correlation analysis, individual messages were used to monitor the AQI in 2013. Our study indicates that the filtered social media messages are strongly correlated to the AQI and can be used to monitor the air quality dynamics to some extent.},

	abstract = {Studies on the health effects of long-term average exposure to outdoor air pollution have played an important role in recent health impact assessments. Exposure assessment for epidemiological studies of long-term exposure to ambient air pollution remains a difficult challenge because of substantial small-scale spatial variation. Current approaches for assessing intra-urban air pollution contrasts include the use of exposure indicator variables, interpolation methods, dispersion models and land-use regression (LUR) models. LUR models have been increasingly used in the past few years. This paper provides a critical review of the different components of LUR models. We identified 25 land-use regression studies. Land-use regression combines monitoring of air pollution at typically 20–100 locations, spread over the study area, and development of stochastic models using predictor variables usually obtained through geographic information systems (GIS). Monitoring is usually temporally limited: one to four surveys of typically one or two weeks duration. Significant predictor variables include various traffic representations, population density, land use, physical geography (e.g. altitude) and climate. Land-use regression methods have generally been applied successfully to model annual mean concentrations of NO2, NOx, PM2.5, the soot content of PM2.5 and VOCs in different settings, including European and North-American cities. The performance of the method in urban areas is typically better or equivalent to geo-statistical methods, such as kriging, and dispersion models. Further developments of the land-use regression method include more focus on developing models that can be transferred to other areas, inclusion of additional predictor variables such as wind direction or emission data and further exploration of focalsum methods. Models that include a spatial and a temporal component are of interest for (e.g. birth cohort) studies that need exposure variables on a finer temporal scale. There is a strong need for validation of LUR models with personal exposure monitoring.},

	abstract = {As part of the EU-funded SAVIAH project, a regression-based methodology for mapping traffic-related air pollution was developed within a GIS environment. Mapping was carried out for NO2 in Amsterdam, Huddersfield and Prague. In each centre, surveys of NO2, as a marker for traffic-related pollution, were conducted using passive diffusion tubes, exposed for four 2-week periods. A GIS was also established, containing data on monitored air pollution levels, road network, traffic volume, land cover, altitude and other, locally determined, features. Data from 80 of the monitoring sites were then used to construct a regression equation, on the basis of predictor environmental variables, and the resulting equation used to map air pollution across the study area. The accuracy of the map was then assessed by comparing predicted pollution levels with monitored levels at a range of independent reference sites. Results showed that the map produced extremely good predictions of monitored pollution levels, both for individual surveys and for the mean annual concentration, with r2 0.79-0.87 across 8-10 reference points, though the accuracy of predictions for individual survey periods was more variable. In Huddersfield and Amsterdam, further monitoring also showed that the pollution map provided reliable estimates of NO2 concentrations in the following year (r2 0.59-0.86 for n 20).},

	abstract = {Background
Low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) face a double burden of malnutrition (DBM), whereby overnutrition and undernutrition coexist within the same individual, household, or population. This analysis investigates global inequalities in household-level DBM, expressed as a stunted child with an overweight mother, and its association with economic, social, and political globalisation across country income and household wealth.
Methods
We pooled anthropometric and demographic data for 1 132 069 children (aged {\textless}5 years) and their mothers (aged 15–49 years) from 189 Demographic and Health Surveys in 55 LMICs between 1992 and 2018. These data were combined with country-level data on economic, social, and political globalisation from the Konjunkturforschungsstelle Globalisation Index and gross national income (GNI) from the World Bank. Multivariate associations between DBM and household wealth, GNI, and globalisation and their interactions were tested using multilevel logistic regression models with country and year fixed-effects and robust standard errors clustered by country.
Findings
The probability of DBM was higher among richer households in poorer LMICs and poorer households in richer LMICs. Economic globalisation was associated with higher odds of DBM among the poorest households (odds ratio 1·49, 95\% CI 1·20–1·86) compared with the richest households. These associations attenuated as GNI increased. Social globalisation was associated with higher odds of DBM (1·39, 95\% CI 1·16–1·65), independently of household wealth or country income. No associations were identified between political globalisation and DBM.
Interpretation
Increases in economic and social globalisation were associated with higher DBM, although the impacts of economic globalisation were mostly realised by the world's poorest. The economic patterning of DBM observed in this study calls for subpopulation-specific double-duty actions, which should further aim to mitigate the potential negative and unequal impacts of globalisation.

	abstract = {Context: The idea of “population” is core to the population sciences but is rarely defined except in statistical terms. Yet who and what defines and makes a population has everything to do with whether population means are meaningful or meaningless, with profound implications for work on population health and health inequities. Methods: In this article, I review the current conventional definitions of, and historical debates over, the meaning(s) of “population,” trace back the contemporary emphasis on populations as statistical rather than substantive entities to Adolphe Quetelet's powerful astronomical metaphor, conceived in the 1830s, of l’homme moyen (the average man), and argue for an alternative definition of populations as relational beings. As informed by the ecosocial theory of disease distribution, I then analyze several case examples to explore the utility of critical population-informed thinking for research, knowledge, and policy involving population health and health inequities. Findings: Four propositions emerge: (1) the meaningfulness of means depends on how meaningfully the populations are defined in relation to the inherent intrinsic and extrinsic dynamic generative relationships by which they are constituted; (2) structured chance drives population distributions of health and entails conceptualizing health and disease, including biomarkers, as embodied phenotype and health inequities as historically contingent; (3) persons included in population health research are study participants, and the casual equation of this term with “study population” should be avoided; and (4) the conventional cleavage of “internal validity” and “generalizability” is misleading, since a meaningful choice of study participants must be in relation to the range of exposures experienced (or not) in the real-world societies, that is, meaningful populations, of which they are a part. Conclusions: To improve conceptual clarity, causal inference, and action to promote health equity, population sciences need to expand and deepen their theorizing about who and what makes populations and their means.},

This predicament has arisen because of ideological, not scientific, constraints on the field of demography--constraints that have a history in how the discipline was formed and financed and in how key demographic agendas become rationalized. The rise of modern feminism, with its commitment to greater gender equality and female empowerment, presents a challenge in this context; it has limited appeal to those who control key resources for demographic research. The article argues for the incorporation of a gender systems approach that directly addresses gender differences in power, autonomy, and well-being, at both the macro and micro levels, and for an expansion of data collection that will permit such analyses. By making gender central to the field, demography will become a more relevant science for understanding social inequality and population change.},

              Malaria diagnosis and treatment data from 315 rural health facility catchments supported by Liberia’s National CHA Program were collected from Liberia’s Health Management Information System and analyzed. Trends in malaria service delivery coverage and quality were assessed between January 2011 and December 2020.
            
            
              Results
              By 2020, four years after the program’s introduction, Liberia’s Community Health Assistants diagnosed 50\% of rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or microscopy-confirmed malaria cases and carried out 51\% of malaria treatments amongst children under age five in rural areas where CHAs were present. Furthermore, the percentage of malaria diagnoses that were confirmed by microscopy or RDT increased from 71\% prior to the program to 95\% in 2020. These results were effectively sustained in rural and remote communities during COVID-19 in 2020.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The introduction of Liberia’s CHA program was associated with improvements in the quality of malaria diagnoses and contributed to treating a significant share of the malaria burden amongst children under age five in remote rural communities across Liberia, and these improvements were sustained during COVID-19. Investments made in rural community health systems can be leveraged by policy makers to strengthen malaria diagnosis, treatment and control, especially in the age of COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Background It is widely accepted that maternal healthcare is vital for improving maternal and neonatal mortality rates. Furthermore, the continuum of care–the integrated delivery of antenatal, delivery and postnatal care–has been shown to be particularly important. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest neonatal and maternal mortality rates in the world; significant improvements in the provision and utilisation of the continuum are urgently needed, therefore the barriers preventing access need to be better understood. This study aimed to identify key factors associated with the utilisation of maternal healthcare, in the Mchinji District of Malawi. Methods 4,244 pregnant women from the Mchinji District of Malawi were interviewed between March and December 2013. The overall utilisation of maternal healthcare was calculated by combining the use of antenatal, delivery and postnatal care into one variable—continuum of care. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to determine the factors associated with utilisation of maternal healthcare. Results Utilisation of maternal healthcare in the Mchinji District was inadequate; only 24\% of women received the recommended package. Being further from a healthcare facility (OR = 0.2, 95\%CI = 0.04–0.96), having at least one live child (OR = 0.87, 95\%CI = 0.84–0.99), previous experience of miscarriage (OR = 0.64, 95\%CI = 0.50–0.82) or abuse (OR = 0.81, 95\%CI = 0.69–0.95) reduced utilisation, whereas being in the richest 20\% (OR = 1.33 95\%CI = 1.08–1.65), having a planned pregnancy (OR = 1.3, 95\%CI = 1.11–1.51) or more control over decisions (OR = 1.09, 95\%CI = 0.80–1.49) increased utilisation. Conclusion Seven groups of women were identified as having an increased risk of low utilisation of maternal healthcare; women living {\textgreater}5km from a healthcare facility, within the poorest socio-economic group, experiencing an unplanned pregnancy, with at least one live child, experience of a previous miscarriage, no control over their healthcare decisions or experience of abuse. Policy makers should pay extra attention to these high-risk groups when designing and delivering strategies to improve maternal healthcare utilisation.},

	abstract = {The research presented here addresses a longstanding but previously unsupported theoretical proposition related to social learning in the demographic literature. This is that individuals should respond to lower (higher) infant mortality of socially proximate others with decreased (increased) fertility. On a more general level this problem directly concerns the translation of the effects of macro-demographic forces such as mortality into micro-level individual behavior through social interaction. Using unique data that combine identification of individuals belonging to women's social networks with direct measurement of these network members' mortality experience, this research demonstrates such a linkage. Information concerning the level and variation in infant mortality available to women from a small Nepalese mountain population in their social networks is seen to influence the tempo of their fertility. It is suggested that the methodology employed has important implications for quantitative analyses of reciprocal processes of social construction and micro-macro linkages more generally.},

Using nationally representative survey data from 13 West and Central African countries, we estimate multilevel discrete-time hazard models to determine how women’s risk of intimate partner violence (IPV) varies with the death of children. We assess heterogeneity in this association across two surrounding circumstances: children’s age at death and regional prevalence of child bereavement. Findings indicate that the risk of IPV initiation rises with the death of children under age 5—for whom women are most intensely responsible—but not with the death of older children. The effect of young child bereavement is most pronounced in regions where it is least prevalent among mothers—a finding not explained by concomitant regional variation in gender inequality, family norms, and infrastructural development. These findings highlight the importance of child mortality for family outcomes beyond fertility in the African context and demonstrate the prominent role of the broader mortality context in shaping these implications.},

Among other linkages, mortality in women's communities and social networks influences their subsequent fertility. Existing demographic research assumes this is principally due to volitional mechanisms, implying that exposure to mortality consolidates women's desire to become pregnant, leading to intended fertility. Yet, insights from other disciplines suggest that mortality exposure could also increase women's unintended fertility through psychological, relational, and behavioral mechanisms. This study examines the relationships between network mortality exposure and women's hazard of pregnancy, and of unintended pregnancy specifically. We analyze two years (2009–2011) of closely spaced panel data on young Malawian women (N=1,272) enrolled in the Tsogolo la Thanzi study. Our data include information on funeral attendance and fertility desires measured weeks before conception, which is confirmed through frequent pregnancy testing. Hazard models show that the number of funerals women attend corresponds with a higher hazard of pregnancy and of unintended pregnancy specifically. These findings make clear that mortality exposure can influence fertility not by shaping women's desires but by disrupting the realization of those desires.},

The least-studied familial relationship in the bereavement literature is that of siblings, although loss of a sibling may also involve health consequences. The authors conducted a follow-up study based on data from the Swedish total population register, covering the period 1981–2002. Using Cox regression, mortality risk ratios for bereaved and nonbereaved persons aged 18–69 years were estimated. All-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality (unnatural causes, natural causes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, suicide, accidents, and all other causes) were examined. In men, the mortality risk for bereaved persons versus nonbereaved persons was 1.26 (95\% confidence interval: 1.22, 1.30), and in women it was 1.33 (95\% confidence interval: 1.28, 1.39). An elevated mortality risk associated with a sibling's death was found in all age groups studied, but the association was generally stronger at younger ages and could be observed predominantly after more than 1 year of follow-up. There was also an increased mortality risk if the sibling had died from a discordant main cause, which may strengthen the possibility that the association observed is not due to confounding alone.},

	abstract = {Women in developing countries are dying from simple preventable conditions but what impact can the procedures collectively called antenatal care have in reducing maternal mortality and morbidity? More importantly what is antenatal care? This review found that questions have been raised about the impact of antenatal care (specifically on maternal mortality) since its inception in developed countries, and that although the questions continue to be asked there is very little research trying to find answers. Many antenatal procedures are essentially screening tests yet it was found that there were very few results showing sensitivity and specificity, and that they rarely complied with the established criteria for the effectiveness of a screening test. The acknowledged gold standard measurement of effectiveness is the randomized controlled trial, yet the only results available referred to nutritional supplementation. This service of flawed methodology has been exported to developing countries and is being promoted by WHO and other agencies. This paper argues that there is insufficient evidence to reach a firm decision about the effectiveness of antenatal care, yet there is sufficient evidence to cast doubt on the possible effect of antenatal care. Research is urgently required in order to identify those procedures which ought to be included in the antenatal process. In the final analysis the greatest impact will be achieved by developing a domiciliary midwifery service supported by appropriate local efficient obstetric services. That this domiciliary service should provide care for women in pregnancy is not disputed but the specific nature of this care needs considerable clarification},

	abstract = {Background
Utilization of antenatal care (ANC) services has increased over the past two decades. Continued gains in maternal and newborn health will require an understanding of both access and quality of ANC services. We linked health facility and household survey data to examine the quality of service provision for five ANC interventions across health facilities in sub–Saharan Africa.

Methods
Using data from 20 nationally representative health facility assessments – the Service Provision Assessment (SPA) and the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA), we estimated facility level readiness to deliver five ANC interventions: tetanus toxoid vaccine for pregnant women, intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in pregnancy (IPTp), syphilis detection and treatment in pregnancy, iron supplementation and hypertensive disease case management. Facility level indicators were stratified by health facility type, managing authority and location, then linked to estimates of ANC utilization in that stratum from the corresponding Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) to generate population level estimates of the ‘likelihood of appropriate care’. Finally, the association between estimates of the ‘likelihood of appropriate care’ from the linking approach and estimates of coverage levels from the DHS were assessed.

Findings
A total of 10 534 health facilities were surveyed in the 20 health facility assessments, of which 8742 reported offering ANC services and were included in the analysis. Health facility readiness to deliver IPTp, iron supplementation, and tetanus toxoid vaccination was higher (median: 84.1\%, 84.9\% and 82.8\% respectively) than readiness to deliver hypertensive disease case management and syphilis detection and treatment (median: 23.0\% and 19.9\% respectively). Coverage of at least 4 ANC visits ranged from 24.8\% to 75.8\%. Estimates of the likelihood of appropriate care derived from linking health facility and household survey data showed marked gaps for all interventions, particularly hypertensive disease case management and syphilis detection and treatment. There was fairly good concordance between our estimates of high likelihood of appropriate care and DHS estimates of coverage for iron supplementation, IPTp, and tetanus toxoid vaccination.

Conclusion
Linking household surveys to health facility assessments revealed marked gaps in population–level coverage of quality ANC interventions and underscored the need for a double–pronged approach to increase ANC utilization and improve the quality of ANC services.},

	abstract = {In this second article of the neonatal survival series, we identify 16 interventions with proven efficacy (implementation under ideal conditions) for neonatal survival and combine them into packages for scaling up in health systems, according to three service delivery modes (outreach, family-community, and facility-based clinical care). All the packages of care are cost effective compared with single interventions. Universal (99\%) coverage of these interventions could avert an estimated 41–72\% of neonatal deaths worldwide. At 90\% coverage, intrapartum and postnatal packages have similar effects on neonatal mortality—two-fold to three-fold greater than that of antenatal care. However, running costs are two-fold higher for intrapartum than for postnatal care. A combination of universal—ie, for all settings—outreach and family-community care at 90\% coverage averts 18–37\% of neonatal deaths. Most of this benefit is derived from family-community care, and greater effect is seen in settings with very high neonatal mortality. Reductions in neonatal mortality that exceed 50\% can be achieved with an integrated, high-coverage programme of universal outreach and family-community care, consisting of 12\% and 26\%, respectively, of total running costs, plus universal facility-based clinical services, which make up 62\% of the total cost. Early success in averting neonatal deaths is possible in settings with high mortality and weak health systems through outreach and family-community care, including health education to improve home-care practices, to create demand for skilled care, and to improve care seeking. Simultaneous expansion of clinical care for babies and mothers is essential to achieve the reduction in neonatal deaths needed to meet the Millennium Development Goal for child survival.

	abstract = {Background Geographic access to obstetric care facilities has a significant influence on women’s uptake of institutional delivery care. However, this effect was not consistent across studies. Some studies reported that geographic access to obstetric care facilities had no influence on the use of facility delivery. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized and pooled the influence of geographic access on institutional delivery service uptake in low and middle-income countries. Methods Multiple combinations of search terms were used to search articles from six databases and a hand search of reference lists performed. We included observational studies conducted in low and middle-income countries which reported the influence of geographic access on delivery care use. The pooled effects of geographic access on institutional delivery care use were calculated using a random-effects model with a 95\% confidence interval. Findings In this study a total of 31 studies were included. Among these studies, 15 met criteria for inclusion in the meta-analyses, while the remaining 16 were summarized using qualitative synthesis. Studies included in the analysis where women had to walk 60 minutes or less to access a health facility delivery were significantly heterogeneous. Having access to obstetric care facilities within five kilometres was significantly associated with institutional deliveries (pooled OR = 2.27; 95\% CI = 1.82, 2.82). Similarly, a travelling time of 60 minutes or less was significantly associated with higher odds of health facility delivery (pooled OR = 3.30; 95\% CI = 1.97, 5.53). Every one-hour and one-kilometre increase in travel time and distance, respectively, was negatively associated with institutional delivery care use. Interpretation Geographic access measured in either physical distance and/or travel time was significantly associated with women’s use of facility delivery. The greater the distance and/or travel time to obstetric care facilities, the greater the barrier and the lesser the service uptake.},

	abstract = {The concept of knowing what works in terms of reducing maternal mortality is complicated by a huge diversity of country contexts and of determinants of maternal health. Here we aim to show that, despite this complexity, only a few strategic choices need to be made to reduce maternal mortality. We begin by presenting the logic that informs our strategic choices. This logic suggests that implementation of an effective intrapartum-care strategy is an overwhelming priority. We also discuss the alternative configurations of such a strategy and, using the best available evidence, prioritise one strategy based on delivery in primary-level institutions (health centres), backed up by access to referral-level facilities. We then go on to discuss strategies that complement intrapartum care. We conclude by discussing the inexplicable hesitation in decision-making after nearly 20 years of safe motherhood programming: if the fifth Millennium Development Goal is to be achieved, then what needs to be prioritised is obvious. Further delays in getting on with what works begs questions about the commitment of decision-makers to this goal.},

In this paper, we aim to better understand the full relationship between distance to providers and utilization of maternal delivery services. We address three methodological challenges: non-linear effects between distance and utilization; unobserved heterogeneity through non-random distance “assignment”; and heterogeneous effects of distance. Linking Malawi Demographic Health Survey household data to Service Provision Assessment facility data, we consider distance as a continuous treatment variable, estimating a Dose-Response Function based on generalized propensity scores, allowing exploration of non-linearities in the effect of an increment in distance at different distance exposures. Using an instrumental variables approach, we examine the potential for unobserved differences between women residing at different distances to health facilities. Our results suggest distance significantly reduces the probability of having a facility delivery, with evidence of non-linearities in the effect. The negative relationship is shown to be particularly strong for women with poor health knowledge and lower socio-economic status, with important implications for equity. We also find evidence of potential unobserved confounding, suggesting that methods that ignore such confounding may underestimate the effect of distance on the utilization of health services.},

Such a discrepancy poses a huge challenge to meeting the fifth Millennium Development Goal to reduce maternal mortality by 75\% between 1990 and 2015. Some developed and transitional countries have managed to reduce their maternal mortality during the past 25 years. Few of these, however, began with the very high rates that are now estimated for the poorest countries—in which further progress is jeopardised by weak health systems, continuing high fertility, and poor availability of data. Maternal deaths are clustered around labour, delivery, and the immediate postpartum period, with obstetric haemorrhage being the main medical cause of death. Local variation can be important, with unsafe abortion carrying huge risk in some populations, and HIV/AIDS becoming a leading cause of death where HIV-related mortaliy rates are high. Inequalities in the risk of maternal death exist everywhere. Targeting of interventions to the most vulnerable—rural populations and poor people—is essential if substantial progress is to be achieved by 2015.},

	abstract = {Background
We undertook a multicentre randomized controlled trial that compared the standard model of antenatal care with a new model that emphasises actions known to be effective in improving maternal or neonatal outcomes and has fewer clinic visits.
Methods
Clinics in Argentina, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and Thailand were randomly allocated to provide either the new model (27 clinics) or the standard model currently in use (26 clinics). All women presenting for antenatal care at these clinics over an average of 18 months were enrolled. Women enrolled in clinics offering the new model were classified on the basis of history of obstetric and clinical conditions. Those who did not require further specific assessment or treatment were offered the basic component of the new model, and those deemed at higher risk received the usual care for their conditions; however, all were included in the new-model group for the analyses, which were by intention to treat. The primary outcomes were low birthweight ({\textless}2500 g), preeclampsia/eclampsia, severe postpartum anaemia ({\textless}90 g/L haemoglobin), and treated urinary-tract infection. There was an assessment of quality of care and an economic evaluation.
Findings
Women attending clinics assigned the new model (n=12 568) had a median of five visits compared with eight within the standard model (n=11 958). More women in the new model than in the standard model were referred to higher levels of care (13·4\% vs 7·3\%), but rates of hospital admission, diagnosis, and length of stay were similar. The groups had similar rates of low birthweight (new model 7·68\% vs standard model 7·14\%; stratified rate difference 0·96 [95\% CI −0·01 to 1·92]), postpartum anaemia (7·59\% vs 8·67\%; 0·32), and urinary-tract infection (5·95\% vs 7·41\%; −0·42 [−1·65 to 0·80]). For pre-eclampsia/eclampsia the rate was slightly higher in the new model (1·69\% vs 1·38\%; 0·21 [−0·25 to 0·67]). Adjustment by several confounding variables did not modify this pattern. There were negligible differences between groups for several secondary outcomes. Women and providers in both groups were, in general, satisfied with the care received, although some women assigned the new model expressed concern about the timing of visits. There was no cost increase, and in some settings the new model decreased cost.
Interpretation
Provision of routine antenatal care by the new model seems not to affect maternal and perinatal outcomes. It could be implemented without major resistance from women and providers and may reduce cost.},

	abstract = {The 2006–2007 Angola Malaria Indicator Survey (AMIS) is the first nationally representative household survey in the country assessing coverage of the key malaria control interventions and measuring malaria-related burden among children under 5 years of age. In this paper, the Angolan MIS data were analyzed to produce the first smooth map of parasitaemia prevalence based on contemporary nationwide empirical data in the country. Bayesian geostatistical models were fitted to assess the effect of interventions after adjusting for environmental, climatic and socio-economic factors. Non-linear relationships between parasitaemia risk and environmental predictors were modeled by categorizing the covariates and by employing two non-parametric approaches, the B-splines and the P-splines. The results of the model validation showed that the categorical model was able to better capture the relationship between parasitaemia prevalence and the environmental factors. Model fit and prediction were handled within a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. Combining estimates of parasitaemia prevalence with the number of children under we obtained estimates of the number of infected children in the country. The population-adjusted prevalence ranges from in Namibe province to in Malanje province. The odds of parasitaemia in children living in a household with at least ITNs per person was by 41\% lower (CI: 14\%, 60\%) than in those with fewer ITNs. The estimates of the number of parasitaemic children produced in this paper are important for planning and implementing malaria control interventions and for monitoring the impact of prevention and control activities.},

In contrast, adaptive geostatistical designs (AGDs) allow collection of geostatistical data over time to depend on information obtained from previous information to optimise data collection towards the analysis objective. AGDs are becoming more important in spatial mapping, particularly in poor resource settings where uniformly precise mapping may be unrealistically costly and the priority is often to identify critical areas where interventions can have the most health impact. Two constructions are: singleton and batch adaptive sampling. In singleton sampling, locations xi are chosen sequentially and at each stage, xk+1 depends on data obtained at locations x1,…,xk. In batch sampling, locations are chosen in batches of size b{\textgreater}1, allowing each new batch, \{x(k+1),…,x(k+b)\}, to depend on data obtained at locations x1,…,xkb. In most settings, batch sampling is more realistic than singleton sampling. We propose specific batch AGDs and assess their efficiency relative to their singleton adaptive and non-adaptive counterparts using simulations. We then show how we are applying these findings to inform an AGD of a rolling Malaria Indicator Survey, part of a large-scale, five-year malaria transmission reduction project in Malawi.},

	abstract = {Background Malaria burden in Uganda has declined disproportionately among regions despite overall high intervention coverage across all regions. The Uganda Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) 2014–15 was the second nationally representative survey conducted to provide estimates of malaria prevalence among children less than 5 years, and to track the progress of control interventions in the country. In this present study, 2014–15 MIS data were analysed to assess intervention effects on malaria prevalence in Uganda among children less than 5 years, assess intervention effects at regional level, and estimate geographical distribution of malaria prevalence in the country. Methods Bayesian geostatistical models with spatially varying coefficients were used to determine the effect of interventions on malaria prevalence at national and regional levels. Spike-and-slab variable selection was used to identify the most important predictors and forms. Bayesian kriging was used to predict malaria prevalence at unsampled locations. Results Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) and Insecticide Treated Nets (ITN) ownership had a significant but varying protective effect on malaria prevalence. However, no effect was observed for Artemisinin Combination-based Therapies (ACTs). Environmental factors, namely, land cover, rainfall, day and night land surface temperature, and area type were significantly associated with malaria prevalence. Malaria prevalence was higher in rural areas, increased with the child’s age, and decreased with higher household socioeconomic status and higher level of mother’s education. The highest prevalence of malaria in children less than 5 years was predicted for regions of East Central, North East and West Nile, whereas the lowest was predicted in Kampala and South Western regions, and in the mountainous areas in Mid-Western and Mid-Eastern regions. Conclusions IRS and ITN ownership are important interventions against malaria prevalence in children less than 5 years in Uganda. The varying effects of the interventions calls for selective implementation of control tools suitable to regional ecological settings. To further reduce malaria burden and sustain malaria control in Uganda, current tools should be supplemented by health system strengthening, and socio-economic development.},

In this study the parasitological data were analyzed: i) to identify climatic/environmental, socio-economic and interventions factors associated with child malaria risk and ii) to produce a contemporary, high spatial resolution parasitaemia risk map of the country. Bayesian geostatistical models were fitted to assess the association between parasitaemia risk and its determinants. Bayesian kriging was employed to predict malaria risk at unsampled locations across Tanzania and to obtain the uncertainty associated with the predictions. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation methods were employed for model fit and prediction. Parasitaemia risk estimates were linked to population data and the number of infected children at province level was calculated. Model validation indicated a high predictive ability of the geostatistical model, with 60.00\% of the test locations within the 95\% credible interval. The results indicate that older children are significantly more likely to test positive for malaria compared with younger children and living in urban areas and better-off households reduces the risk of infection. However, none of the environmental and climatic proxies or the intervention measures were significantly associated with the risk of parasitaemia. Low levels of malaria prevalence were estimated for Zanzibar island. The population-adjusted prevalence ranges from in Kaskazini province (Zanzibar island) to in Mtwara region. The pattern of predicted malaria risk is similar with the previous maps based on historical data, although the estimates are lower. The predicted maps could be used by decision-makers to allocate resources and target interventions in the regions with highest burden of malaria in order to reduce the disease transmission in the country.},

It is likely, however, that most people experience climate change in situ, so understanding the role of population dynamics remains critical. How a given number of people, in a given location and with varying population characteristics may exacerbate or mitigate the impacts of climate change or how, conversely, they may be vulnerable to climate change impacts are basic questions that remain largely unresolved [6]. This paper explores where and to what extent population dynamics intersect with high exposure to climate change. Specifically, in Eastern Africa's Lake Victoria Basin (LVB), a climate change/health vulnerability hotspot we have identified in prior research [7], we model child undernutrition vulnerability indices based on climate variables, including proxy measures (NDVI) derived from satellite imagery, at a 5-km spatial resolution.

	abstract = {Background
Detailed spatial understanding of levels and trends in under-5 mortality is needed to improve the targeting of interventions to the areas of highest need, and to understand the sources of variation in mortality. To improve this understanding, we analysed local-level information on child mortality across sub-Saharan Africa between 1980–2010.
Methods
We used data from 82 Demographic and Health Surveys in 28 sub-Saharan African countries, including the location and timing of 3·24 million childbirths and 393 685 deaths, to develop high-resolution spatial maps of under-5 mortality in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. These estimates were at a resolution of 0·1 degree latitude by 0·1 degree longitude (roughly 10 km × 10 km). We then analysed this spatial information to distinguish within-country versus between-country sources of variation in mortality, to examine the extent to which declines in mortality have been accompanied by convergence in the distribution of mortality, and to study localised drivers of mortality differences, including temperature, malaria burden, and conflict.
Findings
In our sample of sub-Saharan African countries from the 1980s to the 2000s, within-country differences in under-5 mortality accounted for 74–78\% of overall variation in under-5 mortality across space and over time. Mortality differed significantly across only 8–15\% of country borders, supporting the role of local, rather than national, factors in driving mortality patterns. We found that by the end of the study period, 23\% of the eligible children in the study countries continue to live in mortality hotspots—areas where, if current trends continue, the Sustainable Developent Goals mortality targets will not be met. In multivariate analysis, within-country mortality levels at each pixel were significantly related to local temperature, malaria burden, and recent history of conflict.
Interpretation
Our findings suggest that sub-national determinants explain a greater portion of under-5 mortality than do country-level characteristics. Sub-national measures of child mortality could provide a more accurate, and potentially more actionable, portrayal of where and why children are still dying than can national statistics.

This study assesses whether there is any significant difference in the utilization of maternal healthcare services between women from households that experienced any maternal death and women from households that did not experience any maternal death. Data from India’s District Level Households and Facility Survey, 2007–08 were used. A sample of 321 women (unweighted) aged 15–49 years residing in households that had experienced maternal death, and 217 737 women (unweighted) of the same age group living in households that did not experience any maternal death were found eligible for the analysis. Results indicate that women belonging to households that experienced maternal deaths were less likely to opt for full antenatal care [odds ratio (OR): 0.56; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.35–0.88] and postnatal care (OR: 0.82; 95\% CI: 0.61–0.91) compared with women from households that did not experience any maternal death. Conversely, women belonging to households experiencing maternal deaths were more likely to utilize skilled birth attendants (OR: 1.31; 95\% CI: 1.03–1.73) for their last delivery. This study hopes to draw the attention of program and policy makers to improve the reach of antenatal and postnatal care services, which are considered to be a supply side barrier compared with institutional delivery even by households that have reported maternal death.},

The Social Determinants of Health framework emphasizes the role of governance and government policies, the measures for which are rarely incorporated in single-level individual analysis. This study examines factors associated with maternal healthcare utilization in nine high focus states in India, which shares more than half of the total maternal deaths in the country; accounting for individual-, household-, community- and district-level characteristics.Methods The required data are extracted from the third round of the nationally representative District Level Household and Facility Survey conducted during 2007–08. Multilevel analyses were applied to three maternity outcomes, namely, four or more antenatal care visits, skilled birth attendance and post-natal care after birth.Findings Results show that along with individual-/household-level factors, community and district-level factors influence the pattern of utilization of maternal healthcare services significantly. At the community level, the odds of maternal healthcare utilization were lower in rural areas and in communities with a high concentration of poor and illiterate women. Moreover, the average population coverage of primary health centres (PHCs), availability of labour room in PHC and percentage of registered pregnancies were significant factors at the district level that influenced the use of maternity care services. The study also found a strong association between the extent of previous use of maternal healthcare and its effect on subsequent usage patterns.Conclusion This study highlights the role of strengthening public health infrastructure at district level in the study area, and promoting awareness about available healthcare services and subsidized schemes in the community. To reach out to rural and underprivileged communities and to apply a participatory approach from the programme officials are issues to delve into.},

	abstract = {\textbf{\textit{Introduction:}} Health surveys constitute a relevant information source to access the population’s health status. Given that survey errors can significantly influence estimates and invalidate study findings, it is crucial that the fieldwork progress is closely monitored to ensure data quality. The objective of this study was to describe the fieldwork monitoring conducted during the first Portuguese National Health Examination Survey (INSEF) regarding protocol deviations and key performance indicators (KPI). \textbf{\textit{Methods:}} Data derived from interviewer observation and from the statistical quality control of selected KPI were used to monitor the four components of the INSEF survey (recruitment, physical examination, blood collection and health questionnaire). Survey KPI included response rate, average time distribution for procedures, distribution of the last digit in a specific measure, proportion of haemolysed blood samples and missing values. \textbf{\textit{Results:}} Interviewer observation identified deviations from the established protocols, which were promptly corrected. During fieldwork monitoring through KPI, upon implementation of corrective measures, the participation rate increased 2.5-fold, and a 4.4-fold decrease in non-adherence to standardized survey procedures was observed in the average time distribution for blood pressure measurement. The proportion of measurements with the terminal digit of 0 or 5 decreased to 19.6 and 16.5\%, respectively, after the pilot study. The proportion of haemolysed samples was at baseline level, below 2.5\%. Missing data issues were minimized by promptly communicating them to the interviewer, who could recontact the participant and fill in the missing information. \textbf{\textit{Discussion/Conclusion:}} Although the majority of the deviations from the established protocol occurred during the first weeks of the fieldwork, our results emphasize the importance of continuous monitoring of survey KPI to ensure data quality throughout the survey.},

In face-to-face surveys, item nonresponse is influenced by interviewers. Although interviewers are trained to conduct standardized interviews, some obtain a higher number of item nonresponses than others. This study examines interviewer effects on nonresponse to questions about household income, bank balances, and interest and dividend income in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). It first investigates the extent to which interviewers affect nonresponse to income and asset questions and second whether interviewers’ prior expectations regarding respondents’ likelihood to provide information about their income predict actual nonresponse rates. Results of multilevel modeling show that interviewer influence on nonresponse to the income and asset questions was significant at the five percent level. In addition, interviewer expectations were significantly correlated with “don’t know” responses and “refusals.” These results indicate that interviewer expectations matter in the context of income and asset questions and that survey practitioners should take this into account when designing interviewer training.},

Several interviewer characteristics have been found to partially explain variation in respondents’ answers across interviewers, particularly when questions are related to interviewers’ observable characteristics such as gender, race, and age. However, less is known about if and how interviewers’ religious appearance and religious attitudes affect survey responses and, more specifically, reports about religious attitudes. Collecting accurate information on religious attitudes is important, given the sensitivity of this information across the globe and the growing interest in understanding religious perceptions and misconceptions. This paper is the first to investigate (a) the independent effects and the interplay between interviewers’ religious veil status and interviewers’ religious attitudes on respondents’ reported religious attitudes and (b) the magnitude of the interviewer variance explained by interviewers’ religious characteristics. The data comes from a nationally representative survey of religious and political attitudes in Tunisia carried out in 2013. Data from the survey also includes information about interviewers’ characteristics (including veil status for females) and interviewers’ own religious attitudes based on their responses to the same survey questions asked of respondents. Results showed that respondents interviewed by veiled female interviewers reported greater religiosity than respondents interviewed by unveiled female interviewers. Equally important were interviewers’ religious attitudes, which also independently affected the corresponding attitudes of respondents and explained a substantial percentage of the between-interviewer variance for several outcomes. The effect of interviewers’ attitudes on respondents’ attitudes was not stronger among veiled interviewers. Our investigation also revealed that the effect of interviewers’ attitudes on respondents’ reported attitudes operated somewhat differently for male and female respondents depending on the specific survey items. Future studies are needed to explore the mechanism(s) underlying these effects.},

This study examines interviewer effects on these indicators that were collected in two large-scale National Family Health Surveys (NFHS) in India (2005–2006 and 2015–2016). We use cross-classified random intercept multivariable multilevel logit models to examine interviewer effects. In both surveys, we find large interviewer effects on questions about the justification of a woman refusing to have sex with her husband (32–33\% in NFHS-3 and 45–46\% in NFHS-4) and the justification of wife beating (27–28\% in NFHS-3 and 33–34\% in NFHS-4). The interviewer effects were much larger in the 2015–2016 survey than in the 2005–2006 survey. Such large interviewer effects should be considered when interpreting trends and patterns on these topics, especially since the interviewer effects might have changed between survey rounds. Understanding interviewer effects is important given the wide use of these surveys in policy formulation and monitoring in India.},

In this study, we address this gap in understanding by linking item-level response times from wave 3 of the UK Household Longitudinal Survey (UKHLS) to data from an independently conducted survey of interviewers. The linked data file contains over three million records and has a complex, hierarchical structure with response latencies nested within respondents and questions, which are themselves nested within interviewers and areas. We propose the use of a cross-classified mixed-effects location scale model to allow for the decomposition of the joint effects on response times of interviewers, areas, questions, and respondents. We evaluate how interviewer demographic characteristics, personality, and attitudes to surveys and to interviewing affect the length of response latencies and present a new method for producing interviewer-specific intra-class correlations of response times. Hence, the study makes both methodological and substantive contributions to the investigation of response times.},

We find that prenatal exposure to the death of a maternal relative increases take-up of ADHD medications during childhood and anti-anxiety and depression medications in adulthood. Further, family ruptures during pregnancy depress birth outcomes and raise the risk of perinatal complications necessitating hospitalization. Our results suggest large welfare gains from preventing fetal stress from family ruptures and possibly from economically induced stressors such as unemployment. They further suggest that greater stress exposure among the poor may partially explain the intergenerational persistence of poverty. (JEL I12, J12, J13)},

Some women in both the countries manage to overcome these barriers. This paper reports on a comparative qualitative study investigating how some women and their families were able to use professional delivery services. The study provides insights into the decision-making processes and overcoming access barriers. Husbands were found to be particularly important in Uganda, while, in Bangladesh, a number of individuals could influence care-seeking, including unqualified local healers or traditional birth attendants. In both the settings, cost and transport barriers were often overcome through social networks. Social prohibitions on birth in the health facility did not feature strongly in women's accounts, with several Ugandan women explaining that friends or peers also used facilities, while, in Bangladesh, perceived complications apparently justified the use of professional medical care. Investigating the ways in which some women can overcome common barriers can help inform policy and planning to increase the use of health facilities for child delivery.},

Building on these technologies, this article presents a methodology of spatial sampling adopted for the respiratory health and demographic survey conducted in Delhi and its environs from January through April 2004. The overall goal of the survey was to select households that adequately represented exposure to ambient air pollution. The proposed methodology involved constructing a sampling frame of residential areas and the simulation of weighted random points within residential areas. The simulated locations were navigated with the aid of GPS to identify households at these locations and to acquire residents’ consent to participate in the survey; a total of 1,576 households at the 2,000 simulated locations were found suitable and participated in the survey. The average ambient air pollution at the sample sites was not significantly different from the average air pollution observed in the study area, which demonstrates the robustness of the proposed sampling method.},

            Introduction
            Between 2018 and 2022 the Liberian Government implemented the National Community Health Assistant (NCHA) program to improve provision of maternal and child health care to underserved rural areas of the country. Whereas the contributions of this and similar community health worker (CHW) based healthcare programs have been associated with improved process measures, the impact of a governmental CHW program at scale on child mortality has not been fully established.
          
          
            Methods/Design
            We will conduct a cluster sampled, community-based survey with landmark event calendars to retrospectively assess child births and deaths among all children born to women in the Grand Bassa District of Liberia. We will use a mixed effects discrete survival model, taking advantage of the staggered program implementation in Grand Bassa districts over a period of 4 years to compare rates of under-5 child mortality between the pre- and post-NCHA program implementation periods.
          
          
            Discussion
            This study will be the first to estimate the impact of the Liberian NCHA program on under-5 mortality.

	abstract = {The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) have been carried out in over 90 countries since 1984, as interviewer administered household surveys conducted initially by paper and pencil interviews (PAPI). Computer assisted personal interviews (CAPI) were introduced in the 2004 Peru DHS, and since then numerous countries have also switched. However, DHS randomized mode comparisons have been limited. The 2018 Sixth Turkey DHS was conducted using CAPI but allocated one household from 21 in each of 754 clusters to PAPI. This analysis examines a wide range of potential differences between modes: interviewer attitudes toward modes; response rates, underreporting and misreporting of persons or events, number of selections to “check all that applies” questions, respondents' attitudes towards modes reflected by responses to sensitive questions, satisficing behavior such as age heaping, straight-line response patterns, and use of don’t know options; and some operational aspects of modes such as retrospective monthly contraceptive prevalence rates, presence of others during interview, and interview length. Findings show that, despite strong interviewer CAPI preference, CAPI and PAPI were on average almost identical in terms of responses. CAPI took 11 min less (total duration of 33 min). Analysis of retrospective monthly contraception use indicated potential underreporting by CAPI for past use, an issue highlighted before in DHS literature. Overall, the switch to computer technology in DHS surveys does not appear to change estimates or levels of nonsampling errors, although some differences with respect to PAPI mode may need DHS designer attention.},

	abstract = {The key to understanding the experience of AIDS mortality lies in the stories that people tell each other about those they know who are suspected to have died from AIDS. We use a unique set of texts produced by rural Malawians reporting everyday conversations in their communities. These texts, drawn from the online archive of the Malawi Journals Project, consist of several thousand instances of ordinary people telling each other stories in the ordinary course of their lives. They are a form of insider ethnography, accounts of everyday life written by people immersed in the lives of their communities. Through analysis of these texts, we show that narratives of death are predicated upon the question ‘Who is to blame?’ We argue that a micropolitics of blame arises from practices of narrating death and shapes individual and collective responses to the epidemic. When we pay attention to the details of the production and exchange of these stories, we can see how the fact that narratives of death are predicated upon the question of blame both expresses and produces a desire for justice, both for the righting of wrongs through retributive punishment and for the restoration of harmonious social relations among the living. This desire for justice, we argue, is a central feature of the social impact of AIDS., La clé pour comprendre l’expérience de mortalité par le SIDA réside dans les récits que les personnes se racontent mutuellement à propos de ceux qui sont suspectés d’être morts du SIDA. Il utilise pour cela une collection unique de textes produits par des ruraux du Malawi relatant des conversations du quotidien au sein de leurs communautés. Ces textes, tirés des archives en ligne du Malawi Journals Project, consistent en plusieurs milliers de cas de personnes ordinaires se racontant des récits dans le cours ordinaire de leur existence. Ils sont une forme d’ethnographie de l’intérieur, des récits de la vie quotidienne rédigés par des personnes immergées dans la vie de leur communauté. À travers l’analyse de ces textes, l’auteur montre que les récits de mort reposent sur la question « À qui la faute ? ». Il soutient qu’une micropolitique du blâme résulte de pratiques de récit de mort et façonne les réactions individuelles et collectives à l’épidémie. L’étude des détails relatifs à la production et à l'échange de ces récits montre comment le fait que les récits de mort reposent sur la question du blâme exprime et produit un désir de justice, à la fois pour rectifier des tors par une punition rétributive et pour rétablir des relations sociales harmonieuses entre les vivants. Ce désir de justice est, selon l’auteur, un élément central de l’impact social du SIDA.},

	abstract = {Rationale
Risk of maternal mortality increases rapidly during the intrapartum period making skilled care at delivery an effective intervention to reduce the risk of maternal death. Demand generation for skilled care typically focuses on institutional channels; however, much less attention has been paid to whether what women may learn through their social networks can potentially influence their choice of delivery care.
Objective
The objective of this study was to analyze whether a sister's death in childbirth has the potential to improve delivery care choices for women who experience this event.
Methods
This study uses retrospective reports of sister deaths - either in childbirth or from some other cause - reported in the sisterhood moratlity module from five waves of the Indonesia Demographic and Health Surveys (IDHS) spanning 1989 to 2012. A cross-sectional, difference-in-difference strategy compares delivery care behavior of women before and after losing a sister in childbirth to women before and after losing a sister of reproductive age from some other cause in an intent-to-treat framework.
Results
Women are less likely to give birth at home after losing a sister in childbirth relative to women who lose a sister from some other cause. Losing a sister in childbirth may trigger behaviors that help usher women of lower socioeconomic status into formal delivery care.
Conclusion
This study extends the literature on health behavior change through social networks to improve delivery care. Public health campaigns should consider social networks when designing messages around maternal mortality in order to help women at risk of maternal mortality make decisions that reduce their risk of and ultimately avoid maternal death.},

	abstract = {Objective To investigate the extent of geospatial clustering of reported deaths during the Ebola outbreak in Liberia and the covariates associated with the observed clustering.
Design Cross-sectional study.
Participants Male and female respondents from the 2019–2020 Liberia Demographic and Health Survey. The analysis covered 11 928 (women=7854 and men=4074) respondents for whom complete data were available.
Outcome measures The outcome variable was the death of a household member or relative during the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, coded 1 if the respondent reported death and 0 otherwise.
Methods We applied the Bayesian geoadditive semiparametric regression to examine the extent of geospatial clustering of deaths at the district-level and community-level development and socioeconomic factors associated with the observed clustering.
Results Almost a quarter (24.8\%) of all respondents reported the death of a household member or relative during the Ebola outbreak. The results show that deaths were clustered within districts in six (Grand Cape Mount, Bomi, Monsterrado, Margibi, Gbarpolu and Lofa) of the 15 counties in Liberia. Districts with high death clustering were all near or shared borders with Sierra Leone and Guinea. The community-level development indicators (global human footprint, gross cell production and population density) had a non-linear associative effect with the observed spatial clustering. Also, respondents’ characteristics (respondent’s age (non-linear effect), educational attainment and urban-rural place of residence) were associated with the observed clustering. The results show that death clustering during outbreaks was constrained to poor settings and impacts areas of moderate and high socioeconomic development.
Conclusion Reported deaths during the Ebola outbreak in Liberia were not randomly distributed at the district level but clustered. The findings highlight the need to identify at-risk populations during epidemics and respond with the needed interventions to save lives.},

	abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals call for a total reduction of preventable child mortality before 2030. Further, the goals state the desirability to have subnational mortality estimates. Estimates at this level are required for health interventions at the subnational level. In a low and middle income countries context, the data on mortality typically consist of household surveys, which are carried out with a stratified, cluster design, and census microsamples. Most household surveys collect full birth history (FBH) data on birth and death dates of a mother’s children, but censuses collect summary birth history (SBH) data which consist only of the number of children born and the number that died. In previous work, direct (survey-weighted) estimates with associated variances were derived from FBH data and smoothed in space and time. Unfortunately, the FBH data from household surveys are usually not sufficiently abundant to obtain yearly estimates at the Admin-2 level (at which interventions are often made). In this paper we describe four extensions to previous work: (i) combining SBH data with FBH data, (ii) modeling on a yearly scale, to combine data on a yearly scale with data at coarser time scales, (iii) adjusting direct estimates in Admin-2 areas where we do not observe any deaths due to small sample sizes, (iv) acknowledge differences in data sources by modeling potential bias arising from the various data sources. The methods are illustrated using household survey and census data from Kenya and Malawi, to produce mortality estimates from 1980 to the time of the most recent survey, and predictions to 2020.},

The surveys provide jittered coordinates for visited clusters, where coordinates are randomly displaced according to a known jittering distribution. We develop a geostatistical model that accounts for the positional uncertainty when analysing DHS surveys, and provide a fast implementation using Template Model Builder. The approach works for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian likelihoods. A simulation study with binomial data shows that the new approach performs equally or better than the common practice of not accounting for jittering, both in terms of more accurate parameter estimates and improved predictive measures. The improvement increases with increased amount of jittering. An analysis of contraceptive use in Kenya shows that the approach is fast and easy to use in practice.},

	abstract = {Earthquakes occur as a result of global plate motion. However, this simple picture is far from complete. Some plate boundaries glide past each other smoothly, while others are punctuated by catastrophic failures. Some earthquakes stop after only a few hundred metres while others continue rupturing for a thousand kilometres. Earthquakes are sometimes triggered by other large earthquakes thousands of kilometres away. We address these questions by dissecting the observable phenomena and separating out the quantifiable features for comparison across events. We begin with a discussion of stress in the crust followed by an overview of earthquake phenomenology, focusing on the parameters that are readily measured by current seismic techniques. We briefly discuss how these parameters are related to the amplitude and frequencies of the elastic waves measured by seismometers as well as direct geodetic measurements of the Earth's deformation. We then review the major processes thought to be active during the rupture and discuss their relation to the observable parameters. We then take a longer range view by discussing how earthquakes interact as a complex system. Finally, we combine subjects to approach the key issue of earthquake initiation. This concluding discussion will require using the processes introduced in the study of rupture as well as some novel mechanisms. As our observational database improves, our computational ability accelerates and our laboratories become more refined, the next few decades promise to bring more insights on earthquakes and perhaps some answers.},

	abstract = {Purpose – This paper seeks to provide graduate students, researchers, and government and independent agencies with an overview of disasters. Design/methodology/approach – Disasters have been the subject of research and a source of concern to academicians and government and independent agencies. In this paper disaster types are collected from several sources such as technical, general articles, internet web sites, and internal reports. Disaster types, definitions, hazards and mitigations are reviewed. Disasters are classified into natural disasters, man‐made disasters, and hybrid disasters. Man‐made disasters are classified into technological disasters, transportation accidents, public places failure, and production failure. Natural and/or man‐made disasters sometimes lead to subsequent disasters. Findings – Disasters are classified into three types: natural, man‐made, and hybrid disasters. It is believed that the three disaster types cover all disastrous events. Disasters have different characteristics and impacts; however, disasters have a common element, which is their severity. Natural disasters are those disasters that result from natural forces. Man‐made disasters are those disasters that result from human decisions. Hybrid disasters are those disasters that result from both natural and man‐made causes. Subsequent disasters are those disasters that result from natural and/or man‐made disasters. Epidemics could be a disaster or a subsequent disaster. Originality/value – This paper presents the types, definition, hazards, and mitigation of disasters. Disasters are arranged into disaster types, sub‐disasters, and disastrous events in the form of a disaster tree. An algorithm can be written utilizing this disaster tree. The algorithm can be used for training purposes to prevent or reduce disasters.},

The extent of family clustering is estimated before and after controlling for observed child and family demographic, reproductive, and socioeconomic characteristics and unobserved community characteristics. The study also investigates the extent to which the coefficient estimates and standard errors are altered with better controls for unobserved heterogeneity at the family level and at the community level. These controls are achieved through the use of a multilevel nested frailty model for survival data. The variance of family frailty is overstated by a factor of four when unobserved community effects are omitted. The family-level variance is not statistically significant in the multilevel model, although it is highly significant in the model that includes only the family frailty effect.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We aim to examine the phenomenon of infant and child death clustering while considering the unobserved heterogeneity (frailty) at the family level.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We analysed Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2017-2018 data, including the birth history information for 47 828 children born to 18 134 women. We used Gompertz shared frailty model to control the correlation between event times at the mother level and capture the unobserved risks in infant and child deaths.
OUTCOME MEASURES: We estimated two sets of survival regression models where the failure event is the survival status of the index child during the infancy period, that is, from birth to 11 months, and childhood period, that is, between 12 and 59 months, respectively. All children who died during infancy and childhood were coded as 'yes'; otherwise, they were coded as 'no'.
RESULTS: About 2\% of mothers experienced two or more infant deaths, and cumulatively these mothers account for 20\% of all infant deaths in the sample. Children whose previous sibling was not alive at the time of their conception had 1.86 times (95\% CI 1.59 to 2.17) more risk of dying as an infant. However, we did not find a statistically significant effect of death scarring on the risk of child mortality among siblings. Statistically significant frailty effect with a variance of 0.33 (95\% CI CI 0.17 to 0.65) and 0.54 (95\% CI 0.14 to 2.03)] in infancy and childhood, respectively, indicates the clustering of survival risks within families due to unobserved family-level characteristics shared by the siblings.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that preceding birth interval, mother's age at first birth and mother's education are the most critical factors which can help in reducing scaring effect on infant mortality. Additionally, women from poor socioeconomic strata should be focused on as still an infant, and child mortality is concentrated among poor households.},

	abstract = {Objectives Increasing access to skilled birth attendance, usually via childbirth in health facilities, is a key intervention to reduce maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Yet, in some countries of sub-Saharan Africa, the uptake is {\textless}50\%. Age and parity are determinants of facility-based delivery, but are strongly correlated in high fertility settings. This analysis assessed the independent effect of age on facility-based delivery by restricting to first-order births. It was hypothesised that older first-time mothers in this setting might have lower uptake of facility-based deliveries than women in the most common age groups for first birth.
Setting The most recent Demographic and Health Surveys from 34 sub-Saharan African countries were used to assess women’s delivery locations.
Participants 72 772 women having their first birth in the 5 years preceding the surveys were included in the analysis.
Primary and secondary outcome measures Proportions and 95\% CIs of facility-based deliveries were estimated overall and by country. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate the odds of facility-based delivery for different maternal age groups (15–19, 20–24 and ≥25 years) for a pooled sample of all countries.
Results 59.9\% of women had a facility-based delivery for their first birth (95\% CI 58.6 to 61.2), ranging from 19.4\% in Chad to 96.6\% in Rwanda. Compared with women aged 15–19 years, the adjusted odds of having a facility-based delivery for those aged 20–24 was 1.4 (95\% CI 1.3 to 1.5, p{\textless}0.001) and for those aged ≥25, 1.9 (95\% CI 1.6 to 2.2, p{\textless}0.001).
Conclusions Older age at first birth was independently associated with significantly higher odds of facility-based delivery. This went against the hypothesis. Further mixed-method research is needed to explore how increased age improves uptake of facility-based delivery. Promoting facility-based delivery, while ensuring quality of care, should be prioritised to improve birth outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa.},

	abstract = {Introduction Along with the developing world, Bangladesh has made a tremendous improvement in declining total fertility rate, however, this declining trend is not uniform to all the socio-demographic stratum. Incongruities exist between the numbers of children that women bearing and what they actually desired which refers to unmet fertility desire. This study aims to elicit women’s perception of ideal number of children and predictors of unmet fertility desire in Bangladesh. Method This study analyzed nationally representative cross-sectional Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2014 data. A two-stage stratified random sampling technique was used while a total of 17,863 ever-married women were interviewed between June and November 2014. A total of 10,912 eligible women were included in the analysis. Poisson regression analysis and logistic regression models were used to measure women’s perception of the ideal number of children and to determine the influencing factors of unmet fertility desires. Result The mean value of the perceived ideal number of children was 2.22 (SD ± 0.73) and the majority of women (71.2\%) expect to have two children in their lifetime. Approximately 46\% of mothers reported bearing more children than they desired. The perceived ideal number of children was significantly higher among women who were living in rural areas, from Sylhet division, Muslim, unemployed, and experienced child death and those who justified beating. Findings revealed that several factors such as place of residence, geographic location, religion, wealth index, maternal age and education, partners’ education, experiencing child death, and other empowerment-related indicators were significantly associated with unmet fertility desires. Conclusion Perceived ideal number of children differs among women’s socioeconomic and demographic strata. Unmet fertility desire was also found which indicates that reproductive knowledge and health care services are still necessary for some socio-demographically disadvantaged/vulnerable people and this group should be regularly monitored to control population growth.},

	abstract = {Background A woman’s ability to achieve her preferred family size is critical in addressing issues of high fertility in sub-Saharan Africa. The socio-cultural context in sub-Saharan Africa presents some difficulty for the attainment of preferred fertility for many women. Few studies in sub-Saharan Africa have examined the extent to which women are unable to achieve their preferred family sizes. This study, therefore, examines the factors that are associated with the non-attainment of women’s preferred fertility by the end of their reproductive years. Data and methods The study analyzed pooled cross-sectional data with a sub-sample of 1,888 currently married women aged 45–49 years from five rounds of the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, 1993 to 2014. Test of associations and multinomial logistic regression analysis were used to examine the predictors of underachieved and overachieved fertility relative to achieved fertility. Results The results indicate that 44 per cent of the women recorded overachieved fertility while about 36 per cent underachieved their fertility. Partner wants more, experiencing child loss and married more than once were significantly associated with overachieved fertility. Nonetheless, increased years of a woman’s education and delaying her at first birth were negatively associated with overachieved fertility. On the other hand, underachieved fertility was significantly associated with having a partner with fewer fertility preference, being of the Islamic faith and ever use of modern contraception. Conclusion Partner’s fertility preference, child loss experience, marrying more than once and ever use of modern contraception were important predictors of a woman’s inability to achieve her fertility preference. Policies to regulate men’s fertility behaviour, delaying age at first birth, use of modern contraception, encouraging longer years of education, and reducing infant and child mortality are important strategies to achieve fertility preference in Ghana.},

The study used the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey. We applied the conventional neo-classical consumer-theoretic approach to model the demand of children. The study aimed to estimate the demographic effects on fertility among women of reproductive age 15-49 in Ghana using the negative binomial regression. The results indicated that the age of women at first births, mother’s years of education, number of unions, wealth level, women occupations, Partners occupation, contraceptive use and intention, marital status, are significant and negatively associated with the number of children ever born. However, current age of the woman, fertility preference, decision maker on contraceptive use, child sex, number of living children and experienced of the death of a son and/or daughter resulting from replacement effect and hoarding effects and residing in rural areas have positively and significantly influence fertility in Ghana. We recorded variations in the effects of some variables in total, urban and rural samples. We conclude that reduction in child mortality, increasing women access of formal education, increasing women power in decision making on contraceptive use, increasing access to and use of contraceptives as well as reducing income disparity between urban and rural population by providing employment opportunities in rural areas are keys policy issues that could help achieve fertility reduction in Ghana.},

	abstract = {Sub-Saharan Africa has entered the early stage of the demographic transition with differences in and between countries. The relation between fertility preference and actual fertility is at the core of the demographic changes during the demographic transition in sub-Saharan Africa. At the current pace of the demographic transition, overachieved fertility (actual fertility being higher than fertility preference) is more prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa although some women do achieve their fertility preference. Our aim is to assess the trends and identify factors that consistently influence women with completed fertility to achieve their fertility desires in Ghana over a 10-year period. We used secondary data from the 2003, 2008 and 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys for the analysis. The sample size was restricted to currently married/living in union women aged 45–49 years. The results indicate that underachieved fertility has increased from 25.1\% in 2003 to 35.8\% in 2014. Similarly, achieved fertility has also increased from 23.8\% in 2003 to 26.0\% in 2014. On the contrary, overachieved fertility has decreased from 51.1\% in 2003 to 38.2\% in 2014. The most persistent determinants of achieved fertility relative to overachieved fertility in Ghana during the last three rounds of the Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys are child survival status, ethnicity and couple’s fertility preference. The study provides support for programmatic interventions targeting improving child survival and regulating men’s fertility preference.},

	abstract = {A common explanation for the high fertility prevailing in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is a widespread desire for large families. This situation poses a challenge to population policy-makers in the continent. If the desired family size is high, then presumably family planning programs can only have a limited effect on fertility because these programs aim to assist women in achieving their reproductive goals. But this conclusion is based on the assumption that family planning programs do not affect the desired family size, which is questionable and is investigated here. This study examines the determinants of trends wanted and unwanted fertility in SSA using fixed-effects regressions of country-level data. The dependent variables include the total fertility rate, and its wanted and unwanted components. Explanatory variables include a family planning program score and four socioeconomic variables (women’s educational attainment, child mortality, GNI per capita, and percent urban). Data come from 103 DHS surveys in 25 countries in SSA with at least two DHS surveys between 1989 and 2019. Women’s education and family planning programs are found to be the dominant determinants of fertility decline and their effects operate by reducing both wanted and unwanted fertility. The effects of education are not surprising but the finding that family planning programs can reduce wanted fertility implies that their impact can be larger than conventional wisdom suggests. Indeed, in a few poor countries, the implementation of high-quality programs has been associated with substantial declines in wanted fertility (e.g., Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda). The mechanism through which this effect operates is unclear but likely involves media programs that diffuse knowledge about the benefits of smaller families.},

Background Premarital sex and fertility rates are high in many sub-Saharan African countries, yet we know little about how premarital childbirth, or even premarital conception, corresponds with women's subsequent marital outcomes. For instance, it is unknown whether premarital fertility is associated with forming unions that are less stable, polygynous, or more violent. Method We analyze Demographic and Health Survey data for 25 sub-Saharan African countries to describe women's marital experiences following a premarital pregnancy or premarital birth (relative to marital pregnancy and birth). We estimate country-specific, two-stage Heckman probit models to understand whether, conditional on having married, premarital pregnancy or premarital birth is associated with union instability, and among women currently married, polygyny and intimate partner violence. Results In most countries, unions following a premarital pregnancy or premarital birth were less stable relative to unions in which pregnancy occurred only after marriage. Premarital births were also associated with a higher likelihood of entering a polygynous union, especially in West and Central African countries, as well as a greater likelihood of being in a physically violent union, particularly in East and Southern African countries. Conclusion The associations between premarital fertility and women's subsequent marital experiences raise questions about the broader health and life course implications for the women and children involved.},

	abstract = {The impact of the quality of prenatal care on child mortality outcomes has received less attention in sub-Saharan Africa. This study endeavoured to explore the effect of the quality of prenatal care and its individual components on neonatal, infant and under-five mortality. The empirical analysis uses data from the three most recent waves of the nationally representative Demographic and Health Survey for Zimbabwe conducted in 1999, 2005/06 and 2010/11. The results indicate that a one-unit increase in the quality of prenatal care lowers the prospect of neonatal, infant and under-five mortality by approximately 42.33, 30.86 and 28.65\%, respectively. These findings remained roughly the same even after adjusting for potential mediating factors. Examining the effect of individual prenatal care components on child mortality revealed that women who receive information on possible complications arising during pregnancy are less liable to experience a neonatal death. Similarly, women who had blood pressure checks and tetanus immunizations were less likely to experience an infant or under-five death. We did not find any statistically meaningful impact on child mortality outcomes of blood and urine sample checks, iron tablet consumption, and the receipt of malarial tablets. Overall, our results suggest the need for public health policymakers to focus on ensuring high-quality prenatal care to enhance the survival prospects of Zimbabwe’s infants.},

This study describes the context surrounding children’s deaths from the time the illness was first noticed, through the care-seeking patterns leading up to the child’s death, and identifies factors associated with care-seeking for these children in rural Rwanda. Methods Secondary analysis of a verbal and social autopsy study of caregivers who reported the death of a child between March 2013 to February 2014 that occurred after discharge from the child’s birth facility in southern Kayonza and Kirehe districts in Rwanda. Bivariate analyses using Fisher’s exact tests were conducted to identify child, caregiver, and household factors associated with care-seeking from the formal health system (i.e., community health worker or health facility). Factors significant at α = 0.10 significance level were considered for backwards stepwise multivariate logistic regression, stopping when remaining factors were significantly associated with care-seeking at α = 0.05 significance level. Results Among the 516 eligible deaths among children under-five, 22.7\% (n = 117) did not seek care from the health system. For those who did, the most common first point of contact was community health workers (45.8\%). In multivariate logistic regression, higher maternal education (OR = 3.36, 95\% CI: 1.89, 5.98), having diarrhea (OR = 4.21, 95\%CI: 1.95, 9.07) or fever (OR = 2.03, 95\%CI: 1.11, 3.72), full household insurance coverage (3.48, 95\%CI: 1.79, 6.76), and longer duration of illness (OR = 22.19, 95\%CI: 8.88, 55.48) were significantly associated with formal care-seeking. Conclusion Interventions such as community health workers and insurance promote access to care, however a gap remains as many children had no contact with the health system prior to death and those who sought formal care still died. Further efforts are needed to respond to urgent cases in communities and further understand remaining barriers to accessing appropriate, quality care.},

Data were collected from 1511 women who had live births during January 1996–August 1998 in four rural subdistricts, which are the field sites of the Operations Research Project of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh. A structured questionnaire was used to collect information from the mothers who were interviewed in their homes. Forty‐nine per cent of the neonates were reported to have suffered from some kind of morbidity. Fever was the most common morbidity reported in the study population (21 per cent), followed by breathing difficulty (11 per cent). Birth order, complications during pregnancy, and/or delivery and death of a sibling were found to be significantly associated with reported neonatal morbidity. Eighty‐seven per cent of the mothers sought care for their newborns. Some were taken to several different providers, the commonest being homeopaths (38 per cent) and village doctors (37 per cent). Seventeen per cent were taken to trained providers, and only 5 per cent to government health facilities. Seeking care from trained providers was found to be associated with the gender of the neonate, birth order, antenatal care of the mother from trained providers, father's education and monthly expenditure of the family. The results of this study suggest that efforts should be made to raise community awareness regarding neonatal morbidity, the importance of seeking care from trained personnel and the availability of services for these conditions.},

	abstract = {Background
Reductions in neonatal mortality remain stagnant, despite gains in health care access and utilization. Nutrition interventions during antenatal care (ANC) and in the immediate postpartum period are associated with improved neonatal outcomes. Adjusting coverage estimates for the quality of care provided yields greater insight into health system performance and potential population health benefits of accessing care. In this cross-sectional study, we adjust maternity care coverage measures for quality of nutrition interventions to determine the impact on infant birth weight and breastfeeding.

Methods
We used household data from the Malawi 2013-2014 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey to assess use of maternal health services and direct observations of ANC and delivery from the 2013 Service Provision Assessment to measure nutrition interventions provided. We adjusted coverage measures combining self-reported utilization of care with the likelihood of receipt of nutrition interventions. Using adjusted log-linear regression, we estimated the associations of these nutrition quality-adjusted metrics with infant birthweight and immediate breastfeeding.

Results
Health facility data provided over 2500 directly observed clinical encounters and household data provided 7385 individual reports of health care utilization and outcomes. Utilization of ANC and facility-delivery was high. Women received nutrition-related interventions considerably less often than they sought care: over the course of ANC women received a median of 1.6 interventions on iron, 1 instance of nutrition counseling, and 0.06 instances of breastfeeding counseling. Nutrition quality-adjusted ANC coverage was associated with a reduced risk of low birthweight (adjusted relative risk [ARR] 0.87, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.79, 0.96) and increased likelihood of immediate breastfeeding (ARR = 1.04, 95\% CI = 1.02, 1.07); nutrition quality-adjusted post-delivery care was also associated with greater uptake of immediate breastfeeding (ARR = 1.08, 95\% CI = 1.02, 1.14). Based on these models, delivering nutrition interventions consistently within the existing level of coverage would decrease population prevalence of low birthweight from 13.7\% to 10.8\% and increase population prevalence of immediate breastfeeding from 75.9\% to 86.0\%.

Conclusions
Linking household survey data to health service provision assessments demonstrates that despite high utilization of maternal health services in Malawi, low provision of nutrition interventions is undermining infant health. Substantial gains in newborn health are possible in Malawi if quality of existing services is strengthened.},

	abstract = {Background
Ensuring quality of care during pregnancy and childbirth is crucial to improving health outcomes and reducing preventable mortality and morbidity among women and their newborns. In this pursuit, WHO developed a framework and standards, defining 31 quality statements and 352 quality measures to assess and improve quality of maternal and newborn care in health-care facilities. We aimed to assess the capacity of globally used, large-scale facility assessment tools to measure quality of maternal and newborn care as per the WHO framework.
Methods
We identified assessment tools through a purposive sample that met the following inclusion criteria: multicountry, facility-level, major focus on maternal and newborn health, data on input and process indicators, used between 2007 and 2017, and currently in use. We matched questions in the tools with 274 quality measures associated with inputs and processes within the WHO standards. We excluded quality measures relating to outcomes because these are not routinely measured by many assessment tools. We used descriptive statistics to calculate how many quality measures could be assessed using each of the tools under review. Each tool was assigned a 1 for fulfilling a quality measure based on the presence of any or all components as indicated in the standards.
Findings
Five surveys met our inclusion criteria: the Service Provision Assessment (SPA), developed for the Demographic and Health Surveys programme; the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment, developed by WHO; the Needs Assessment of Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care developed by the Averting Maternal Death and Disability programme at Columbia University; and the World Bank's Service Delivery Indicator (SDI) and Impact Evaluation Toolkit for Results Based Financing in Health. The proportion of quality measures covered ranged from 62\% for the SPA to 12\% for the SDI. Although the broadest tool addressed parts of each of the 31 quality statements, 68 (25\%) of 274 input and process quality measures were not measured at all. Measures of health information systems and patient experience of care were least likely to be included.
Interpretation
Existing facility assessment tools provide a valuable way to assess quality of maternal and newborn care as one element within the national measurement toolkit. Guidance is clearly needed on priority measures and for better harmonisation across tools to reduce measurement burden and increase data use for quality improvement. Targeted development of measurement modules to address important gaps is a key priority for research.

	abstract = {Extreme weather events pose significant threats to urban health in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where there are systemic health challenges. This paper investigates health system vulnerabilities associated with flooding and extreme heat, along with strategies for resilience building by service providers and community members, in Accra and Tamale, Ghana. We employed field observations, rainfall records, temperature measurements, and semi-structured interviews in health facilities within selected areas of both cities. Results indicate that poor building conditions, unstable power supply, poor sanitation and hygiene, and the built environment reduce access to healthcare for residents of poor urban areas. Health facilities are sited in low-lying areas with poor drainage systems and can be 6 °C warmer at night than reported by official records from nearby weather stations. This is due to a combination of greater thermal inertia of the buildings and the urban heat island effect. Flooding and extreme heat interact with socioeconomic conditions to impact physical infrastructure and disrupt community health as well as health facility operations. Community members and health facilities make infrastructural and operational adjustments to reduce extreme weather stress and improve healthcare provision to clients. These measures include: mobilisation of residents to clear rubbish and unclog drains; elevating equipment to protect it from floods; improving ventilation during extreme heat; and using alternative power sources for emergency surgery and storage during outages. Stakeholders recommend additional actions to manage flood and heat impacts on health in their cities, such as, improving the capacity of drainage systems to carry floodwaters, and routine temperature monitoring to better manage heat in health facilities. Finally, more timely and targeted information systems and emergency response plans are required to ensure preparedness for extreme weather events in urban areas.},

	abstract = {Objective
To systematically review the public health literature to assess trends in the use of Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data for research from 1984 to 2010 and to describe the relationship between data availability and data utilization.

Methods
The MEASURE DHS web site was searched for information on all population-based surveys completed under the DHS project between 1984 and 2010. The information collected included the country, type of survey, survey design, fieldwork period and certain special features, such as inclusion of biomarkers. A search of PubMed was also conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles published during 2010 that analysed DHS data and included an English-language abstract. Trends in data availability and in the use of DHS data for research were assessed through descriptive, graphical and bivariate linear regression analyses.

Findings
In total, 236 household surveys under the DHS project were completed across 84 countries during 2010. The number of surveys per year has remained constant, although the scope of the survey questions has expanded. The inclusion criteria were met by 1117 peer-reviewed publications. The number of publications has increased progressively over the last quarter century, with an average annual increment of 4.3 (95\% confidence interval, CI: 3.2–5.3) publications. Trends in the number of peer-reviewed publications based on the use of DHS data were highly correlated with trends in funding for health by the Government of the United States of America and globally.

Conclusion
Published peer-reviewed articles analysing DHS data, which have increased progressively in number over the last quarter century, have made a substantial contribution to the public health evidence base in developing countries.},

This note presents a simple method to improve change estimates by detecting and correcting erroneous changes resulting from positional errors. It allows an important reduction of error in change area estimates and is likely to be useful in LUCC assessment studies.},

	abstract = {Background Further improvements in population health in low- and middle-income countries demand high-quality care to address an increasingly complex burden of disease. Health facility surveys provide an important but costly source of information on readiness to provide care. To improve the efficiency of health system measurement, we applied unsupervised machine learning methods to assess the performance of the service readiness index (SRI) defined by the World Health Organization and compared it to empirically derived indices. Methods We drew data from nationally representative Service Provision Assessment surveys conducted in 10 countries between 2007 and 2015. We extracted 649 items in domains such as infrastructure, medication, and management to calculate an index using all available information and classified facilities into quintiles. We compared three approaches against the full item set: the SRI, a new index based on sequential backward selection, and an enriched SRI that added empirically selected items to the SRI. We evaluated index performance with a cross-validated kappa statistic comparing classification using the candidate index against the 649-item index. Results 9238 facilities were assessed. The 49-item SRI performed poorly against the index using all 649 items, with a kappa value of 0.35. New empirically derived indices with 50 and 100 items captured much more information, with cross-validated kappa statistics of 0.71 and 0.80, respectively. Items varied across the indices and in sensitivity analyses. A 100-item enriched SRI reliably captured the information from the full index: 83\% of the facilities were classified into correct quintiles of service readiness based on the full index. Conclusion A facility readiness measure developed by global health experts performed poorly in capturing the totality of readiness information collected during facility surveys. Using a machine learning approach with sequential selection and cross-validation to identify the most informative items dramatically improved performance. Such approaches can make assessment of health facility readiness more efficient. Further improvements in measurement will require identification of external criteria—such as patient outcomes—to guide and validate measure development.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess existing knowledge related to methodological considerations for linking population-based surveys and health facility data to generate effective coverage estimates. Effective coverage estimates the proportion of individuals in need of an intervention who receive it with sufficient quality to achieve health benefit.
DESIGN: Systematic review of available literature.
DATA SOURCES: Medline, Carolina Population Health Center and Demographic and Health Survey publications and handsearch of related or referenced works of all articles included in full text review. The search included publications from 1 January 2000 to 29 March 2021.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Publications explicitly evaluating (1) the suitability of data, (2) the implications of the design of existing data sources and (3) the impact of choice of method for combining datasets to obtain linked coverage estimates.
RESULTS: Of 3805 papers reviewed, 70 publications addressed relevant issues. Limited data suggest household surveys can be used to identify sources of care, but their validity in estimating intervention need was variable. Methods for collecting provider data and constructing quality indices were diverse and presented limitations. There was little empirical data supporting an association between structural, process and outcome quality. Few studies addressed the influence of the design of common data sources on linking analyses, including imprecise household geographical information system data, provider sampling design and estimate stability. The most consistent evidence suggested under certain conditions, combining data based on geographical proximity or administrative catchment (ecological linking) produced similar estimates to linking based on the specific provider utilised (exact match linking).
CONCLUSIONS: Linking household and healthcare provider data can leverage existing data sources to generate more informative estimates of intervention coverage and care. However, existing evidence on methods for linking data for effective coverage estimation are variable and numerous methodological questions remain. There is need for additional research to develop evidence-based, standardised best practices for these analyses.},

	abstract = {Introduction Health Management Information Systems (HMIS) are vital to ensure accountability and for making decisions including for tracking the Sustainable Development Goals. The Ethiopia Health Sector Transformation Plan II includes preventing data falsification as a major strategic initiative and our study aimed to explore the reasons why healthcare providers intentionally falsify maternal and newborn health (MNH) data in two regions of Ethiopia.
Methods We conducted a qualitative study in two hospitals, four health centres and their associated health posts in Oromia and Amhara regions. We conducted 45 in-depth interviews with health facility managers, quality improvement (QI) focal persons, health information technicians, MNH care providers, Health Extension Workers and QI mentors. Data were collected in local languages and transcribed in English. During analysis we repeatedly read the transcripts, coded them inductively using NVivo V.12, and categorised the codes into themes.
Results Participants were hesitant to report personal data falsification but many reported that falsification is common and that they had experienced it in other facilities or had been told about it by other health workers. Falsification was mostly inflating the number of services provided (such as deliveries). Decreasing the number of deaths or reclassifying neonatal death into stillbirths was also reported. An overarching theme was that the health system focuses on, and rewards, the number of services provided over any other metric. This focus led to both system and individual level incentives for falsification and disincentives for accurate reporting.
Conclusion Our finding suggests that to reduce facility level data falsification policy makers might consider disentangling reward and punishments from the performance reports based on the routine HMIS data. Further studies examining the high-level drivers of falsification at regional, national and global levels and effective interventions to address the drivers of data falsification are needed.},

	abstract = {Introduction Prompt access to emergency obstetrical care (EmOC) reduces the risk of maternal mortality. We assessed institutional maternal mortality by distance and travel time for pregnant women with obstetrical emergencies in Lagos State, Nigeria.
Methods We conducted a facility-based retrospective cohort study across 24 public hospitals in Lagos. Reviewing case notes of the pregnant women presenting between 1 November 2018 and 30 October 2019, we extracted socio-demographic, travel and obstetrical data. The extracted travel data were exported to Google Maps, where driving distance and travel time data were extracted. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to determine the relative influence of distance and travel time on maternal death.
Findings Of 4181 pregnant women with obstetrical emergencies, 182 (4.4\%) resulted in maternal deaths. Among those who died, 60.3\% travelled ≤10 km directly from home, and 61.9\% arrived at the hospital ≤30 mins. The median distance and travel time to EmOC was 7.6 km (IQR 3.4–18.0) and 26 mins (IQR 12–50). For all women, travelling 10–15 km (2.53, 95\% CI 1.27 to 5.03) was significantly associated with maternal death. Stratified by referral, odds remained statistically significant for those travelling 10–15 km in the non-referred group (2.48, 95\% CI 1.18 to 5.23) and for travel ≥120 min (7.05, 95\% CI 1.10 to 45.32). For those referred, odds became statistically significant at 25–35 km (21.40, 95\% CI 1.24 to 36.72) and for journeys requiring travel time from as little as 10–29 min (184.23, 95\% CI 5.14 to 608.51). Odds were also significantly higher for women travelling to hospitals in suburban (3.60, 95\% CI 1.59 to 8.18) or rural (2.51, 95\% CI 1.01 to 6.29) areas.
Conclusion Our evidence shows that distance and travel time influence maternal mortality differently for referred women and those who are not. Larger scale research that uses closer-to-reality travel time and distance estimates as we have done, rethinking of global guidelines, and bold actions addressing access gaps, including within the suburbs, will be critical in reducing maternal mortality by 2030.},

	abstract = {Introduction Geographic access to family planning (FP) services has been characterised through a variety of proximity metrics. However, there is little evidence on the validity of women’s self-reported compared with modelled travel time to an FP outlet, or between different distance measures.
Methods We used data from four urban sites in Kenya. A longitudinal FP outlet census was directly linked with data from cross-sectional FP user surveys. We combined characteristics of outlet visited to obtain FP, transport mode, self-reported travel time and location of households and outlets with data on road networks, elevation, land use and travel barriers within a cost-distance algorithm to compute modelled travel time, route and Euclidean distance between households and outlets. We compared modelled and self-reported travel times, Euclidean and route distances and the use of visited versus nearest facility.
Results 931 contraceptive users were directly linked to their FP source. Self-reported travel times were consistently and significantly higher than modelled times, with greater differences for those using vehicles rather than walking. Modelled and Euclidean distances were similar in the four geographies. 20\% of women used their nearest FP outlet while 52\% went to their nearest outlet when conditional on it offering their most recently used FP method.
Conclusion In urban areas with high facility density and good road connectivity, over half of FP users visited their nearest outlet with their chosen method available. In these settings, Euclidean distances were sufficient to characterise geographic proximity; however, reported and modelled travel times differed across all sites.},

It is therefore critical to ensure that all possible data, tools and methods are fully exploited to help address this gap. Among the methods that are under-used, mapping has always represented a powerful way to ‘tell the story’ of a health problem in an easily understood way. In addition to this, the advanced analytical methods and models now being embedded into Geographic Information Systems allow a more in-depth analysis of the causes behind adverse maternal and newborn health (MNH) outcomes. This paper examines the current state of the art in mapping the geography of MNH as a starting point to unleashing the potential of these under-used approaches. Using a rapid literature review and the description of the work currently in progress, this paper allows the identification of methods in use and describes a framework for methodological approaches to inform improved decision-making. The paper is aimed at health metrics and geography of health specialists, the MNH community, as well as policy-makers in developing countries and international donor agencies.},

	abstract = {Background Malawi has halved the neonatal mortality rate between 1990–2018, however, is not on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 12 per 1,000 live births. Despite a high facility birth rate (91\%), mother-newborn dyads may not remain in facilities long enough to receive recommended care and quality of care improvements are needed to reach global targets. Physical access and distance to health facilities remain barriers to quality postnatal care. Methods Using data We used individual data from the 2015–16 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey and facility data from the 2013–14 Malawi Service Provision Assessment, linking households to all health facilities within specified distances and travel times. We calculated service readiness scores for facilities to measure their capacity to provide birth/newborn care services. We fitted multi-level regression models to evaluate the association between the service readiness and appropriate newborn care (receiving at least five of six interventions). Results Households with recent births (n = 6010) linked to a median of two birth facilities within 5–10 km and one facility within a two-hour walk. The maximum service environment scores for linked facilities median was 77.5 for facilities within 5–10 km and 75.5 for facilities within a two-hour walk. While linking to one or more facilities within 5-10km or a two-hour walk was not associated with appropriate newborn care, higher levels of service readiness in nearby facilities was associated with an increased risk of appropriate newborn care. Conclusions Women’s choice of nearby facilities and quality facilities is limited. High quality newborn care is sub-optimal despite high coverage of facility birth and some newborn care interventions. While we did not find proximity to more facilities was associated with increased risk of appropriate care, high levels of service readiness was, showing facility birth and improved access to well-prepared facilities are important for improving newborn care.},

Long distance to health facilities is one of the known barriers to access. We investigated the effect of networked and Euclidean distances from home to formal health facilities on childhood mortality in rural Tanzania between 2005 and 2007. Methods : A secondary analysis of data from a cohort of 28,823 children younger than age 5 between 2005 and 2007 from Ifakara Health and Demographic Surveillance System was carried out. Both Euclidean and networked distances from the household to the nearest health facility were calculated using geographical information system methods. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to investigate the effect of distance from home to the nearest health facility on child mortality. Results : Children who lived in homes with networked distance {\textgreater}5 km experienced approximately 17\% increased mortality risk (HR=1.17; 95\% CI 1.02–1.38) compared to those who lived {\textless}5 km networked distance to the nearest health facility. Death of a mother (HR=5.87; 95\% CI 4.11–8.40), death of preceding sibling (HR=1.9; 95\% CI 1.37–2.65), and twin birth (HR=2.9; 95\% CI 2.27–3.74) were the strongest independent predictors of child mortality. Conclusions : Physical access to health facilities is a determinant of child mortality in rural Tanzania. Innovations to improve access to health facilities coupled with birth spacing and care at birth are needed to reduce child deaths in rural Tanzania.},

	abstract = {Background
Poor maternal health service utilization is one of the contributing factors to a high level of maternal and newborn mortality in Ethiopia. The factors associated with utilization of services are believed to differ from one context to another. We assessed the factors associated with skilled delivery service utilization in rural northern Ethiopia.

Subjects and methods
A community-based survey was conducted among mothers who gave birth in the 12 months preceding the study period, from January to February 2015, in the Tigray region of Ethiopia. Multistage sampling technique was used to select mothers from the identified clusters. Households within a 10 km radius of the health facility were taken as a cluster for a community survey. Data were collected using face-to-face interview at the household level. We compared the mothers who reported giving birth to the index child in a health facility and those who reported delivering at home, in order to identify the predictors of skilled delivery utilization. Multivariable logistic regression model was used to determine the predictors of skilled delivery service utilization. The results are presented with odds ratio (OR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI).

Results
A total of 1,796 mothers participated in the study, with a 100\% response rate. Distance to health facilities (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] =0.53 [95\% CI: 0.39, 0.71]), perception of mothers to the availability of adequate equipment in the delivery service in their catchment area (AOR =1.5 [95\% CI: 1.11, 2.13]), experiencing any complication during childbirth, using antenatal care, lower birth order and having an educated partner were the significant predictors of skilled delivery service utilization.

Conclusion
Implementing community-based intervention programs that will address the physical accessibility of delivery services, such as the ambulance service, road issues and waiting rooms, and improving quality maternity service will likely reduce the current problem.},

	abstract = {Universal access to health care requires service availability and accessibility for those most in need of maternal and child health services. Women often bypass facilities closest to home due to poor quality. Few studies have directly linked individuals to facilities where they sought maternal and child health services and examined the role of distance and quality on this facility choice. Using endline data from a longitudinal survey from a sample of women in five cities in Kenya, we examine the role of distance and quality on facility selection for women using delivery, facility-based contraceptives, and child health services. A survey of public and private facilities offering reproductive health services was also conducted. Distances were measured between household cluster location and both the nearest facility and facility where women sought care. A quality index score representing facility infrastructure, staff, and supply characteristics was assigned to each facility. We use descriptive statistics to compare distance and quality between the nearest available facility and visited facility among women who bypassed the nearest facility. Facility distance and quality comparisons were also stratified by poverty status. Logistic regression models were used to measure associations between the quality and distance to the nearest facility and bypassing for each outcome. The majority of women bypassed the nearest facility regardless of service sought. Women bypassing for delivery traveled the furthest and had the fewest facility options near their residential cluster. Poor women bypassing for delivery traveled 4.5 km further than non-poor women. Among women who bypassed, two thirds seeking delivery and approximately 46\% seeking facility-based contraception or child health services bypassed to a public hospital. Both poor and non-poor women bypassed to higher quality facilities. Our findings suggest that women in five cities in Kenya prefer public hospitals and are willing to travel further to obtain services at public hospitals, possibly related to free service availability. Over time, it will be important to examine service quality and availability in public sector facilities with reduced or eliminated user fees, and whether it lends itself to a continuum of care where women can visit one facility for multiple services reducing travel burden.},

	abstract = {Health policy-makers in developing countries are often disturbed and to a degree surprised by the phenomenon of the ill travelling past a free or subsidized local public clinic (or other public facility) to get to an alternative source of care at which they often pay a considerable amount for health care. That a person bypasses a facility is almost certainly indicative either of significant problems with the quality of care at the bypassed facility or of significantly better care at the alternative source of care chosen. When it is a poor person choosing to bypass a free public facility and pay for care further away, such action is especially bothersome to public policy-makers.This paper uses a unique data set, with a health facility survey in which all health facilities are identified, surveyed, and located geographically; and a household survey in which a sample of households from the same health district is also both surveyed and located geographically. The data are analyzed to examine patterns of health care choice related to the characteristics and locations of both the facilities and actual and potential clients. Rather than using the distance travelled or some other general choice of type of care variable as the dependent variable, we are able actually to analyze which specific facilities are bypassed and which chosen. The findings are instructive. That bypassing behaviour is not very different across income groups is certainly noteworthy, as is the fact that the more severely ill tend to bypass and to travel further for care than do the less severely ill. In multivariate analysis almost all characteristics of both providers and facilities are found to have the a priori expected relationships to facility choice. Prices tend to deter use, and improved quality of services to increase the likelihood of a facility being chosen. The answer to the bypassing dilemma seems to be for providers to provide as good quality care relative to the money charged (if any), as other, often further away, providers.},

	abstract = {Introduction There is growing recognition in the health community that the legal environment—including laws, policies, and related procedures—impacts vulnerability to HIV and access to HIV-related services both positively and negatively. Assessing changes in the legal environment and how these affect HIV-related outcomes, however, is challenging, and understanding of appropriate methodologies nascent. Methods We conducted an evaluation of a UNDP project designed to strengthen legal environments to support the human rights of key populations, in particular LGBT populations, women and girls, affected by HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. We analyzed data on activities designed to improve legal environments through a systematic document review and 53 qualitative interviews. Results The project made substantial strides towards legal change in many places, and examples provide broader lessons for work in this area. Two core pillars appear fundamental: a government-led participatory assessment of the legal environment, and building the capacity of those impacted by and engaged in this work. Systematic attention to human rights is vital: it can help open new spaces for dialogue among diverse stakeholders, foster new collaborations, and ensure local ownership, nuanced understanding of the political landscape, attention to marginalized populations, and accountability for (in)action. Entry points for effecting legal change go beyond “HIV laws” to also include other laws, national policies and strategies. Conclusion Conducting legal environment assessments, multi-stakeholder dialogues, action planning and related activities, alongside capacity building, can contribute to changes in knowledge and attitudes directly relevant to reforming laws that are found to be harmful. Shorter-term goals along the causal pathway to legal change (e.g. changes in policy) can constitute interim markers of success, and recognition of these can maintain momentum. Increasing understanding of progress towards changes in the legal environment that can positively affect HIV-related outcomes is important in working to improve the health and lives of people living with HIV.},

	abstract = {Maps of infectious disease—charting spatial variations in the force of infection, degree of endemicity and the burden on human health—provide an essential evidence base to support planning towards global health targets. Contemporary disease mapping efforts have embraced statistical modelling approaches to properly acknowledge uncertainties in both the available measurements and their spatial interpolation. The most common such approach is Gaussian process regression, a mathematical framework composed of two components: a mean function harnessing the predictive power of multiple independent variables, and a covariance function yielding spatio-temporal shrinkage against residual variation from the mean. Though many techniques have been developed to improve the flexibility and fitting of the covariance function, models for the mean function have typically been restricted to simple linear terms. For infectious diseases, known to be driven by complex interactions between environmental and socio-economic factors, improved modelling of the mean function can greatly boost predictive power. Here, we present an ensemble approach based on stacked generalization that allows for multiple nonlinear algorithmic mean functions to be jointly embedded within the Gaussian process framework. We apply this method to mapping Plasmodium falciparum prevalence data in sub-Saharan Africa and show that the generalized ensemble approach markedly outperforms any individual method.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Reliable data on sexual behavior are needed to identify adolescents at risk of acquiring human immunodeficiency virus or other sexually transmitted diseases, as well as unintended pregnancies. This study aimed to investigate whether schooling status and literacy and numeracy skills affect adolescents' reports of premarital sex, collected using audio computer-assisted self-interviews.
Methods
We analyzed data on 2,320 participants in the first three rounds of the Malawi Schooling and Adolescent Study to estimate the level of inconsistency in reporting premarital sex among rural Malawian adolescents. We used multivariate logistic regressions to examine the relationships between school status and academic skills and premarital sexual behavior reports.
Results
Males were more likely than females to report premarital sex at baseline, whereas females were more likely than males to report sex inconsistently within and across rounds. School-going females and males were more likely to report never having had sex at baseline and to retract reports of ever having sex across rounds than were their peers who had recently left school. School-going females were also more likely to report sex inconsistently at baseline. Literate and numerate respondents were less likely to report sex inconsistently at baseline; however, they were more likely to retract sex reports across rounds.
Conclusions
The level of inconsistency both within a survey round and across rounds reflects the difficulties in collecting reliable sexual behavior data from young people in settings such as rural Malawi, where education levels are low and sex among school-going females is not socially accepted.},

	abstract = {Context: Adolescents' sexual behavior is an important issue in developing countries and a focus of programmatic efforts for reducing pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease. Yet the accuracy of young people's reports of their sexual activity has rarely been carefully examined. Methods: Data from a three-round longitudinal study of 698 young adolescents in Jamaica were used to examine consistency in the reporting of first sexual intercourse. Adolescents were asked to respond to multiple questions about their first intercourse within each round of the survey, and the items were repeated in subsequent rounds. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the factors independently influencing the likelihood that adolescents would report their sexual experience inconsistently. Results: The vast majority of respondents (95-100\%) reported their sexual experience status consistently within a given survey round. However, when agreement of responses between rounds was examined, 37\% of respondents-12\% of girls and 65\% of boys-responded inconsistently. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that boys were nearly 14 times as likely as girls to report their sexual experience inconsistently. Conclusions: Pervasive inconsistency in the reporting of sexual activity, especially among boys, highlights the limitations of relying on self-reported data to identify sexually active adolescents and to quantify that activity. Using such data to evaluate the impact of interventions designed to delay first intercourse may also be problematic.},

Larger standard errors in adjusted than in naive/unadjusted regression models demonstrated the existence of interviewer effects on responding,but these were only attributable to interviewer gender or age for a small number of specific topics. Men interviewed by women reported fewer sexual partners and were less likely to report sex with strangers than men interviewed by men; they were more likely to report sex with prostitutes or other men to older than to younger interviewers. Women were less likely to report oral sex to older interviewers. Sexual behavior surveys should evaluate and, where detected, adjust for fixed interviewer effects and should routinely report interviewer numbers, panel sizes, and other characteristics.},

We find that the period after the earthquake was associated with an increase in the total number of healthcare facilities, inpatient beds, and surgical facilities and that international aid has been a driving force behind this recovery. Aid has funded 12 of 13 new healthcare facilities that have opened since the earthquake as well as the reconstruction of 7 of 8 healthcare facilities that have been rebuilt. Despite increases in free, aid-financed healthcare, private Haitian healthcare facilities have remained at a constant number. The planned phase-out of several aid-financed facilities, however, will leave Leogane with fewer inpatient beds and healthcare services compared with the pre-earthquake period.},

We conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with the directors of local, collaborative, and aid-funded healthcare facilities in Leogane, Haiti. We coded and analysed the interviews using an iterative method based on a grounded theory approach of data analysis. Healthcare providers identified positive aspects of aid, including acute emergency relief, long-term improved healthcare access, and increased ease of referrals for low-income patients. However, they also identified negative impacts of international aid, including episodes of poor quality care, internal brain drain, competition across facilities, decrease in patient flow to local facilities, and emigration of Haitian doctors to abroad. As Haiti continues to recover, it is imperative for aid institutions and local healthcare facilities to develop a more collaborative relationship to transition acute relief to sustainable capacity building. In future disaster contexts, aid institutions should specifically utilise quality of care metrics, NGO Codes of Conduct, Master Health Facility Lists, and sliding scale payment systems to improve disaster response.},

The ability to reliably communicate information about specific health facilities can support an array of health system functions, such as routine reporting and emergency response operations. MHFLs support the alignment of donor-supported health information systems with county-owned systems. Recent World Health Organization draft guidance promotes the utility of MHFLs and outlines a process for list development and governance. Although the potential benefits of MHFLs are numerous and may seem obvious, there are few documented cases of MHFL construction and use. The international response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake provides an example of how governments, nongovernmental organizations, and others can collaborate within a framework of standards to build a more complete and accurate list of health facilities. Prior to the earthquake, the Haitian Ministry of Health (Ministère de la Santé Publique et de la Population [MSPP]) maintained a list of public-sector health facilities but lacked information on privately managed facilities. Following the earthquake, the MSPP worked with a multinational group to expand the completeness and accuracy of the list of health facilities, including information on post-quake operational status. This list later proved useful in the response to the cholera epidemic and is now incorporated into the MSPP's routine health information system. Haiti's experience demonstrates the utility of MHFL formation and use in crisis as well as in the routine function of the health information system.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to contribute to the evidence on the timing of sexual debut in young people in sub-Saharan African countries. Data were extracted from 34 nationally representative surveys conducted in the region between 2006 and 2014. The study sample comprised unmarried women (n=167,932) and men (n=76,900) aged 15–24 years. Descriptive techniques and Cox proportional regression models were used to estimate the timing of sexual debut, and Kaplan–Meier hazard curves were used to describe the patterns of sexual debut in each country by sex. For the countries studied, sexual debut for both women and men occurred between the ages of 15 and 18 years, with median ages of 16 for women and 17 for men. Overall, education and household wealth provided significant protection against early sexual debut among women, but the reverse was found among men for wealth. Women in rural areas, in female-headed households and in Central, South and West Africa reported higher hazards of early commencement of sexual activity than their counterparts in urban, male-headed households and East Africa. However, the impact of these variables on male sexual debut did not follow a consistent pattern. Varied timing, as well as country-specific risk factors associated with sexual debut for young women and men across sub-Saharan Africa, were identified. Sexual health programmes and interventions for young people may require different approaches for young women and men.},

Included in the scope of the synthesis is research literature that has focused on explaining variability among interviewers in these effects and the different types of variable errors that they can introduce, which can ultimately affect the efficiency of survey estimates. We first consider common tasks with which human interviewers are often charged and then use the TSE framework to organize and synthesize the literature discussing the variable errors that interviewers can introduce when attempting to execute each task. Based on our synthesis, we identify key gaps in knowledge and then use these gaps to motivate an organizing model for future research investigating explanations for interviewer effects on different aspects of the survey data collection process.},

This report systematically reviewed the use of social desirability scales in studies addressing social desirability in clinical psychology. Method A systematic review (January 2010–March 2015) was conducted, including 35 studies meeting the inclusion criteria of being published in peer-reviewed journals and describing quantitative findings about an association of social desirability with clinical psychology variables using a cross-sectional or longitudinal design. Results Social desirability was associated with self-reports of various clinical-psychological dimensions. Most of the included studies treated social desirability as a 1-dimensional variable and only 10 of 35 disentangled the impression management and self-deception components. Although theoretical literature does not consider social desirability a mere response bias, only 4 of the reviewed articles controlled for the possible suppressor effect of personality variables on social desirability, while the majority focused upon the stylistic (response bias) rather than the substantive (personality) nature of this construct. Conclusion The present review highlighted some limitations in the use of social desirability scales in recent clinical psychology research and tried to offer a few suggestions for handling this issue.},

	abstract = {Background
Mass deworming against soil-transmitted helminthiasis, which affects 1 billion of the poorest people globally, is one of the largest public health programmes for neglected tropical diseases, and is intended to be equitable. However, the extent to which treatment programmes for deworming achieve equitable coverage across wealth class and sex is unclear and the public health metric of national deworming coverage does not include representation of equity. This study aims to measure both coverage and equity in global, national, and subnational deworming to guide future programmatic evaluation, investment, and metric design.
Methods
We used nationally representative, geospatial, household data from Demographic and Health Surveys that measured mother-reported deworming in children of preschool age (12–59 months). Deworming was defined as children having received drugs for intestinal parasites in the previous 6 months before the survey. We estimated deworming coverage disaggregated by geography, wealth quintile, and sex, and computed an equity index. We examined trends in coverage and equity index across countries, within countries, and over time. We used a regression model to compute the household correlates of deworming and ecological correlates of equitable deworming.
Findings
Our study included 820 883 children living in 50 countries from Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe that are endemic for soil-transmitted helminthiasis using 77 Demographic and Health Surveys from December, 2003, to October, 2017. In these countries, the mean deworming coverage in preschool children was estimated at 33·0\% (95\% CI 32·9–33·1). The subnational coverage ranged from 0·5\% to 87·5\%, and within-country variation was greater than between-country variation. Of the 31 countries reporting that they reached the WHO goal of more than 75\% national coverage, 30 had inequity in deworming, with treatment concentrated in wealthier populations. We did not detect systematic differences in deworming equity by sex.
Interpretation
Substantial inequities in mass deworming programmes are common as wealthier populations have consistently higher coverage than that of the poor, including in countries reporting to have reached the WHO goal of more than 75\% national coverage. These inequities seem to be geographically heterogeneous, modestly improving over time, with no evidence of sex differences in inequity. Future reporting of deworming coverage should consider disaggregation by geography, wealth, and sex with incorporation of an equity index to complement the conventional public health metric of national deworming coverage.

Although introductory in its early sections, the book is definitely not elementary in the sense of a first text in statistics. The mathematics used in our book is basic probability and statistics, elementary calculus, and linear algebra. A review of probability notation is given in Chapter 1 along with a more detailed list of topics assumed to have been studied. The practical orientation of the book means that the reader's previous experience in probability, statistics, and linear algebra should ideally have included strong computational components. To write an introductory text alone would leave many readers with only a taste of the conceptual elements but no guidance for venturing into genuine practical applications, beyond those where Bayesian methods agree essentially with standard non-Bayesian analyses. On the other hand, we feel it would be a mistake to present the advanced methods without first introducing the basic concepts from our data-analytic perspective. Furthermore, due to the nature of applied statistics, a text on current Bayesian methodology would be incomplete without a variety of worked examples drawn from real applications. To avoid cluttering the main narrative, there are bibliographic notes at the end of each chapter and references at the end of the book"--},

After adjusting for individual-level factors, poor road conditions significantly reduce the likelihood of timely receipt of antenatal care and of four or more antenatal care visits, while the availability of a health centre within 5 kilometres significantly increases the odds of each outcome. The odds of being attended at delivery by trained medical personnel and of institutional delivery are significantly reduced by mountainous terrain and distance from the nearest hospital, and are increased if a health worker providing antenatal care is present in the neighbourhood. Neighbourhood poverty reduces the likelihood of safe delivery care. The findings suggest that improving the use made of maternal healthcare services would require, among other things, improvement of the availability of services and road conditions, and the reduction of poverty.},

Using the DHS information on women aged 15 to 49 who had given birth during the three years preceding the survey interview, this study was intended to: (1) examine the determinants of the likelihood of the women using prenatal care in the rural areas and in the urban areas of the country and (2) for the women who made at least one prenatal care visit, examine the determinants of the number of prenatal visits in the rural areas and the urban areas. METHODS: The multivariate analysis used logistic models to identify which factors explained the decision to seek prenatal care, and negative binomial models were used to determine how many prenatal visits were conducted by the subgroup of women who did make prenatal care visits. RESULTS: Estimated at the mean values of the control variables, the expected probability of using prenatal care services in rural Haiti was 77.16\%, compared to 85.83\% in urban Haiti. Among users of prenatal care services, mothers in rural areas made an expected number of 3.78 prenatal care visits, compared to 5.06 visits for the women in urban areas. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial percentage of pregnant women have access to prenatal care services in Haiti, but mothers in rural areas who decided to seek care still fell slightly below the four visits recommended by the World Health Organization. The education levels of both mothers and their partners is a dominant predictor of prenatal care use. Longer travel times and greater distances to health centers in rural areas constituted barriers to repeated visits. Policymakers and health care providers need to take these findings into consideration as they decide on the delivery and management of health care services in Haiti.},

	abstract = {BackgroundBetween 2005 and 2050, the human population is forecast to grow by 2.7 billion, with the vast majority of this growth occurring in low income countries. This growth is likely to have significant social, economic and environmental impacts, and make the achievement of international development goals more difficult. The measurement, monitoring and potential mitigation of these impacts require high resolution, contemporary data on human population distributions. In low income countries, however, where the changes will be concentrated, the least information on the distribution of population exists. In this paper we investigate whether satellite imagery in combination with land cover information and census data can be used to create inexpensive, high resolution and easily-updatable settlement and population distribution maps over large areas.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe examine various approaches for the production of maps of the East African region (Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda and Tanzania) and where fine resolution census data exists, test the accuracies of map production approaches and existing population distribution products. The results show that combining high resolution census, settlement and land cover information is important in producing accurate population distribution maps.ConclusionsWe find that this semi-automated population distribution mapping at unprecedented spatial resolution produces more accurate results than existing products and can be undertaken for as little as \$0.01 per km2. The resulting population maps are a product of the Malaria Atlas Project (MAP: http://www.map.ox.ac.uk) and are freely available.},

Half the interviewers were given biassing true and false information about the event; half were given no information. As predicted, only poor interviewers showed the effect of bias. Poor interviewers asked fewer open questions in the biassed condition than the non-biassed condition; good interviewers asked the same (high) proportion of open questions in both conditions. Poor interviewers asked more leading questions in the biassed condition than the non-biassed condition; good interviewers asked the same (low) proportion of leading questions in both conditions.

	abstract = {In his recent writings on the subject of marriage and kinship, Malinowski has repeatedly emphasized what he terms the ‘principle legitimacy’. By this he means the rule, found in all human societies, that a woman has to be married before she is allowed legitimately to conceive. ‘Roughly speaking, an unmarried mother is under a ban, a fatherless child is a bastard. This is by no means only a European or Christian prejudice; it is the attitude found amongst most barbarous and savage peoples as well.’ Where prenuptial intercourse is regarded as illicit and immoral, marriage is obviously the essential prelude to the birth of legitimate children, i.e. children having full social status in the community. But even where prenuptial intercourse is tolerated, this tolerance does not extend to liberty of conception. The unmarried boys and girls may indulge freely in sex, but there must be no issue. An unmarried mother will be subjected to punishment and become the object of scorn, her child possibly killed or aborted, while often the putative father is also penalized unless he marries the girl. Almost universally, a child born out of wedlock has a different status from the legitimate offspring, usually very much to his disadvantage. Facts such as these show that the group of mother and child is considered incomplete in the eyes of the community, and that the sociological position of husband and father is everywhere felt to be indispensable.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the reporting of premarital sex in rural southern Malawi. It summarizes the results of an interview-mode experiment conducted with unmarried young women aged 15–21 in which respondents were randomly assigned to either an audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) or a conventional face-to-face (FTF) interview. In addition, biomarkers were collected for HIV and three STIs: gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. Prior to collecting the biomarkers, nurses conducted a short face-to-face interview in which they repeated questions about sexual behavior. The study builds on earlier research among adolescents in Kenya where we first investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of ACASI. In both Malawi and Kenya, the mode of interviewing and questions about types of sexual partners affect the reporting of sexual activity. Yet the results are not always in accordance with expectations. Reporting for “ever had sex” and “sex with a boyfriend” is higher in the FTF mode. When we ask about other partners as well as multiple lifetime partners, however, the reporting is consistently higher with ACASI, in many cases significantly so. The FTF mode produced more consistent reporting of sexual activity between the main interview and a subsequent interview. The association between infection status and reporting of sexual behavior is stronger in the FTF mode, although in both modes a number of young women who denied ever having sex test positive for STIs/HIV.},

Several response distributions are supported, of which all parameters (e.g., location, scale, and shape) can be predicted at the same time thus allowing for distributional regression. Non-linear relationships may be specified using non-linear predictor terms or semi-parametric approaches such as splines or Gaussian processes. To make all of these modeling options possible in a multilevel framework, brms provides an intuitive and powerful formula syntax, which extends the well known formula syntax of lme4. The purpose of the present paper is to introduce this syntax in detail and to demonstrate its usefulness with four examples, each showing other relevant aspects of the syntax.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND African censuses and surveys remain dependent on interviewers for data collection. Data quality is assured through training and supervision. Many survey concepts are difficult to translate into African languages and some, such as “household”, may have multiple criteria which are not fulfilled by everyone, leading interviewers to prioritise different criteria. Some questions introduce unfamiliar ideas which require considerable negotiation by interviewers to obtain acceptable answers. OBJECTIVE To identify key stages in the data collection process and domains where interviewer judgement and interviewer-respondent social dynamics play a substantial role in determining who is included in household surveys, and in shaping responses to questions. METHODS We analyse published definitions, enumerator manuals and qualitative interview data with households, interviewers, supervisors, trainers, survey organisers and analysts along the chain of data production and use in Tanzania, Uganda, Senegal and Burkina Faso. RESULTS Despite comprehensive training manuals and definitions, interviewers influence who is included in, and excluded from surveys. Interviewer versatility needs to include both persuasive social skills and an ability to follow precise wording. In Africa, where survey concepts are often different from local concepts and where interviewers are socio-economically distant from respondents, these persuasive social skills are required throughout the interview process with unknown impact on the data produced. Language diversity is a major barrier to harmonisation. CONCLUSIONS To improve survey data validity more effort should be made to understand the influence of interviewers on data in low-income settings.

It reviews qualitative impressions of insider-and stranger-related issues within the specific Kenyan field setting, drawing primarily on field notes. Relevant areas of social theory and the data collection literature are reviewed briefly. Finally, using the project's longitudinal survey data, empirical tests are presented which allow for an evaluation of differential data quality across insider-and stranger-interviewers on three dimensions: differential response rates, differential reliability of responses, and differential response validity. The results suggest that insider-interviewers increase response rates and collect more consistent data across survey waves. They also suggest that data collected by female insiders in particular appear to be superior for most questions and of equal quality for others.},

	abstract = {Objectives The analysis aimed to assess the scale of interviewer effects on abortion survey responses, to compare interviewer effects between different question wordings and between direct and indirect approaches, and to identify interviewer and interview characteristics that explain interviewer effects on abortion reporting.
Setting 2018 Performance Monitoring for Action nationally representative household surveys from Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria and Rajasthan, India.
Participants Survey data from 20 016 interviews with reproductive age (15–49) women, selected using multistage stratified cluster sampling. Data from self-administered interviewer surveys and from a sample of health service delivery points that serve the female survey participants were also included.
Primary outcome measures Outcomes were the respondent’s own experience of ever ‘removing a pregnancy’, their closest confidante’s experience of pregnancy removal and the respondent’s own experience of period regulation.
Results Substantial interviewer effects were observed, ranging from 7\% in Côte d’Ivoire to 24\% in Nigeria for pregnancy removal. Interviewer effects for survey questions that were designed to ask about abortion in a less stigmatising way were either similar to (9\%–26\% for confidante-reporting) or higher than (17\%–32\% for a question about period regulation) the pregnancy removal question. Interviewer and interview characteristics associated with abortion reporting included respondent–interviewer familiarity, the language of interview and the interviewer’s comfort asking questions about abortion.
Conclusion This study highlights that questions designed to be less stigmatising may increase interviewer effects due to lower comprehension among respondents. Further work is needed to assess question wordings for different contexts. Selecting and training interviewers to ensure comfort asking questions about abortion is important for reproductive health surveys. Challenges for the use of ‘insider’ interviewers and the management of surveys in countries with high linguistic diversity are also identified.},

In this article, we introduce the novel, publically available data extraction system Terra Populus (TerraPop), which was designed to facilitate population–environment studies. We showcase the use of TerraPop by exploring variations in the climate–migration association in Burkina Faso and Senegal based on differences in the local food security context. Food security was approximated using anthropometric indicators of child stunting and wasting derived from Demographic and Health Surveys and linked to the TerraPop extract of climate and migration information. We find that an increase in heat waves was associated with a decrease in international migration from Burkina Faso, while excessive precipitation increased international moves from Senegal. Significant interactions reveal that the adverse effects of heat waves and droughts are strongly amplified in highly food insecure Senegalese departments.},

	abstract = {Despite making significant progress in tackling its HIV epidemic, South Africa, with 7.7 million people living with HIV, still has the biggest HIV epidemic in the world. The Government, in collaboration with developmental partners and agencies, has been strengthening its responses to the HIV epidemic to better target the delivery of HIV care, treatment strategies and prevention services. Population-based household HIV surveys have, over time, contributed to the country’s efforts in monitoring and understanding the magnitude and heterogeneity of the HIV epidemic. Local-level monitoring of progress made against HIV and AIDS is increasingly needed for decision making. Previous studies have provided evidence of substantial subnational variation in the HIV epidemic. Using HIV prevalence data from the 2016 South African Demographic and Health Survey, we compare three spatial smoothing models, namely, the intrinsically conditionally autoregressive normal, Laplace and skew-t (ICAR-normal, ICAR-Laplace and ICAR-skew-t) in the estimation of the HIV prevalence across 52 districts in South Africa. The parameters of the resulting models are estimated using Bayesian approaches. The skewness parameter for the ICAR-skew-t model was not statistically significant, suggesting the absence of skewness in the HIV prevalence data. Based on the deviance information criterion (DIC) model selection, the ICAR-normal and ICAR-Laplace had DIC values of 291.3 and 315, respectively, which were lower than that of the ICAR-skewed t (348.1). However, based on the model adequacy criterion using the conditional predictive ordinates (CPO), the ICAR-skew-t distribution had the lowest CPO value. Thus, the ICAR-skew-t was the best spatial smoothing model for the estimation of HIV prevalence in our study.},

	abstract = {Concern about the human impact of climate change has led to predictions of how people living in areas vulnerable to drought, flood, and temperature changes will respond to such events. Early studies warned that climate change would lead to dramatic increases in human migration as households became unable to adapt to the impacts of climate change. More recently, empirical studies focused on observed climate events and trends have documented how migration flows vary as a function of both the severity of the event and the ability of the household to migrate, among other factors. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of this literature, based on a conceptual framework in which climate shocks (e.g., drought, floods, or temperature extremes) affect (a) household capability to migrate, by depleting household resources necessary for migration, and (b) household vulnerability in staying, by increasing the risk that a household falls (further) into poverty. In combination, these factors help explain four key patterns seen in the empirical literature: (1) climate-induced migration is not necessarily more prevalent among poorer households; (2) climate-induced migration tends to be more prevalent for long-distance domestic moves than local or international moves; (3) slow-onset climate changes (such as droughts) are more likely to induce increased migration than rapid-onset changes (such as floods); and (4) the severity of climate shocks impacts migration in a nonlinear fashion, with impacts influenced by whether the capability or vulnerability channel dominates.},

The use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in investigating the relative importance of geographical factors on utilisation patterns is advocated through a review of published studies and a call made for more research to examine potential relationships with for example health outcomes. Recent advances with regard to the availability of detailed geographically disaggregate data and new location-based techniques such as developments in Global Positioning Systems (GPS) hold out great promise in such regards. Finally the policy relevance of such studies is re-iterated in terms of helping to tackle perceived inequities in the system, addressing health inequalities as well as gauging the effectiveness of current and planned service configurations.},

The objective of this scoping review was to conduct an evaluation of studies using spatial statistics approaches for national health survey data in the SSA region. An organized literature search for studies related to spatial statistics and national health surveys was conducted through PMC, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, NLM Catalog, and Science Direct electronic databases. Of the 4,193 unique articles identified, 153 were included in the final review. Spatial smoothing and prediction methods were predominant (n = 108), followed by spatial description aggregation (n = 25), and spatial autocorrelation and clustering (n = 19). Bayesian statistics methods and lattice data modelling were predominant (n = 108). Most studies focused on malaria and fever (n = 47) followed by health services coverage (n = 38). Only fifteen studies employed nonstandard spatial analyses (e.g., spatial model assessment, joint spatial modelling, accounting for survey design). We recommend that for future spatial analysis using health survey data in the SSA region, there must be an improve recognition and awareness of the potential dangers of a na\&iuml;ve application of spatial statistical methods. We also recommend a wide range of applications using big health data and the future of data science for health systems to monitor and evaluate impacts that are not well understood at local levels.},

Data on schistosomiasis determinants, obtained through literature review, the Philippine Department of Health, and concerned local government units, were standardized and incorporated into a GIS map using ArcGIS. Data gathered included modifiable [agriculture, poverty, sanitation, presence of intermediate and reservoir hosts, disease prevalence and mass drug administration (MDA) coverage] and nonmodifiable (geography and climate) determinants for schistosomiasis. Results showed that most barangays (villages) are characterized by favourable conditions for schistosomiasis transmission which include being located in flood-prone areas, presence of vegetation, low sanitary toilet coverage, presence of snail intermediate host, high carabao (water buffalo) population density, previously reported ≥1\% prevalence using Kato-Katz technique, and low MDA coverage. Similarly, barangays not known to be endemic for schistosomiasis but also characterized by the same favourable conditions for schistosomiasis as listed above and may therefore be considered as potentially endemic, even if not being high-risk areas. This study demonstrated the importance of GIS technology in characterizing schistosomiasis transmission. Maps generated through application of GIS technology are useful in guiding program policy and planning at the local level for an effective and sustainable schistosomiasis control and prevention.},

A child was considered as anaemic if the bloodhaemoglobin count was less than 11.0 g/dL. We applied Kulldorf’s spatial scan statistics and used SaTScanTM to identify locations and estimate cluster sizes. In addition, we ran the local indicator of spatial association and the Getis-Ord Gi* statistics to detect and locate hotspots and multilevel multivariable analysis to identify risk factors for anaemia clustering. More than half of children aged 6-59 months (57\%) were found to be anaemic in Ethiopia.

In this paper, we analyse data from 20 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in 13 African countries to investigate the relationship between malaria and stunting. Our objective is to make inference on the association between malaria incidence during the first year of life and height-for-age Z-scores (HAZs).},

	abstract = {Spatial weight matrices play a key role in econometrics to capture spatial effects. However, these constructs are prone to clustering and can be challenging to analyse in common statistical packages such as STATA. Multiple observations of survey participants in the same location (or cluster) have traditionally not been dealt with appropriately by statistical packages. It is common that participants are assigned Geographic Information System (GIS) data at a regional or district level rather than at a small area level. For example, the Demographic Health Survey (DHS) generates GIS data at a cluster level, such as a regional or district level, rather than providing coordinates for each participant. Moreover, current statistical packages are not suitable for estimating large matrices such as 20,000 × 20,000 (reflective of data within large health surveys) since the statistical package limits the N to a smaller number. In addition, in many cases, GIS information is offered at an aggregated level of geographical areas. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a bootstrap approach that generates an inverse distance spatial weight matrix for application in econometric analyses of health survey data. The new approach is illustrated using DHS data on uptake of HIV testing in low and middle income countries.},

Adjusted versions of these measures are usually estimated by maximum likelihood regression (eg, logistic, Poisson, or Cox modelling). But resulting estimates of effect measures can have serious bias when the data lack adequate case numbers for some combination of exposure and outcome levels. This bias can occur even in quite large datasets and is hence often termed sparse data bias. The bias can arise or be worsened by regression adjustment for potentially confounding variables; in the extreme, the resulting estimates could be impossibly huge or even infinite values that are meaningless artefacts of data sparsity. Such estimate inflation might be obvious in light of background information, but is rarely noted let alone accounted for in research reports. We outline simple methods for detecting and dealing with the problem focusing especially on penalised estimation, which can be easily performed with common software packages.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This research synthesis uses the Total Survey Error (TSE) framework to highlight important historical developments and advances in the study of interviewer effects on a variety of important survey process outcomes, including sample frame coverage, contact and recruitment of potential respondents, survey measurement, and data processing. Included in the scope of the synthesis is research literature that has focused on explaining variability among interviewers in these effects and the different types of variable errors that they can introduce, which can ultimately affect the efficiency of survey estimates. We first consider common tasks with which human interviewers are often charged and then use the TSE framework to organize and synthesize the literature discussing the variable errors that interviewers can introduce when attempting to execute each task. Based on our synthesis, we identify key gaps in knowledge and then use these gaps to motivate an organizing model for future research investigating explanations for interviewer effects on different aspects of the survey data collection process.},

Yet, there is a lack of conceptual insights on the contextual factors that push individuals to opt for healthy or unhealthy food outlets when both options are accessible. Our comprehension of foodscape influences on dietary behaviours would benefit from a better understanding of the decision-making process for food outlet choices. In this paper, we build on the fundamental position that outlet choices are conditioned by how much outlets’ attributes accommodate individuals’ constraints and preferences. We further argue that food outlets continuously experienced within individuals’ daily-path help people re-evaluate food acquisition possibilities, push them to form intentions, and shape their preferences for the choices they will subsequently make. Doing so, we suggest differentiating access, defined as the potential for the foodscape to be used at the time when individuals decide to do so, from exposure, which acts as a constant catalyst for knowledge, intention, preferences and routine tendency. We conclude with implications for future research, and discuss consequences for public policy.},

However, existing spatially explicit population data across Africa are generally based on outdated, low resolution input demographic data, and provide insufficient detail to quantify rural settlement patterns and, thus, accurately measure population concentration and accessibility. Here we outline approaches to developing a new high resolution population distribution dataset for Africa and analyse rural accessibility to population centers. Contemporary population count data were combined with detailed satellite-derived settlement extents to map population distributions across Africa at a finer spatial resolution than ever before. Substantial heterogeneity in settlement patterns, population concentration and spatial accessibility to major population centres is exhibited across the continent. In Africa, 90\% of the population is concentrated in less than 21\% of the land surface and the average per-person travel time to settlements of more than 50,000 inhabitants is around 3.5 hours, with Central and East Africa displaying the longest average travel times. The analyses highlight large inequities in access, the isolation of many rural populations and the challenges that exist between countries and regions in providing access to services. The datasets presented are freely available as part of the AfriPop project, providing an evidence base for guiding strategic decisions.},

For me the parallel is black music, which is as splendid and complicated and wonderful as it is because its audience was within; its primary audience. The fact that it has become universal, worldwide, anyone, everyone can play it, and it has evolved, was because it wasn’t tampered with, and editorialised, within the community. So, I wanted the literature that I wrote to be that way. I could just go straight to where the soil was, where the fertility was in this landscape. And also, I wanted to feel free not to have the white gaze in this place that was so precious to me…

{\textgreater} ​And I have spent my entire writing life trying to make sure that the white gaze was not the dominant one in any of my books. The people who helped me most arrive at that kind of language were African writers… Those writers who could assume the centrality of their race because they were African. And they didn’t explain anything to white people… “Things Fall Apart” [by Chinua Achebe] was more important to me than anything only because there was a language, there was a posture, there were the parameters. I could step in now, and I didn’t have to be consumed by or concerned by the white gaze.

The purpose of this study is to contribute with evidence for decision-making on the reform of the country’s healthcare map, by analyzing the availability and readiness of services at the facilities that may become part of a Hospital Complex in Bissau, proposed in the National Health Development Plan.Material and Methods: We analyzed 13 public and private facilities with inpatient capacity, located in Bissau and Biombo. Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) tools were used for data collection, treatment and analysis.Results: A comprehensive overview of these facilities has been provided, describing their general capacity to provide care and their readiness to implement it, along with the availability and readiness of specific services: diagnosis, family planning, mother and child health, obstetrics, communicable and non communicable diseases, blood transfusion and surgery. We observed a greater concentration of beds and professionals in the facilities of public sector, the only that provides all the specific services analyzed. Private sector services with agreements to supply the public sector have higher readiness levels and the private sector has the lowest operating capacity.Discussion: Findings reflect the lack of equipment, infrastructure and resources, the predominance of the public sector and the growth of the private for-profit and non-profit sectors, as well as inadequacies in planning and regulation. Similarities and differences between our findings and those described in the literature for other African countries are identified.Conclusion: This study reinforces the relevance of developing integrated and rational responses of health services and provides evidence for this.},

	abstract = {Background
              Pneumonia remains the leading cause of child mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy was developed to standardise care in low-income and middle-income countries for major childhood illnesses and can effectively improve healthcare worker performance. Suboptimal clinical evaluation can result in missed diagnoses and excess morbidity and mortality. We estimate the sensitivity of pneumonia diagnosis and investigate its determinants among children in Malawi.
            
            
              Methods
              Data were obtained from the 2013–2014 Service Provision Assessment survey, a census of health facilities in Malawi that included direct observation of care and re-examination of children by trained observers. We calculated sensitivity of pneumonia diagnosis and used multilevel log-binomial regression to assess factors associated with diagnostic sensitivity.
            
            
              Results
              3136 clinical visits for children 2–59 months old were observed at 742 health facilities. Healthcare workers completed an average of 30\% (SD 13\%) of IMCI guidelines in each encounter. 573 children met the IMCI criteria for pneumonia; 118 (21\%) were correctly diagnosed. Advanced practice clinicians were more likely than other providers to diagnose pneumonia correctly (adjusted relative risk 2.00, 95\% CI 1.21 to 3.29). Clinical quality was strongly associated with correct diagnosis: sensitivity was 23\% in providers at the 75th percentile for guideline adherence compared with 14\% for those at the 25th percentile. Contextual factors, facility structural readiness, and training or supervision were not associated with sensitivity.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Care quality for Malawian children is poor, with low guideline adherence and missed diagnosis for four of five children with pneumonia. Better sensitivity is associated with provider type and higher adherence to IMCI. Existing interventions such as training and supportive supervision are associated with higher guideline adherence, but are insufficient to meaningfully improve sensitivity. Innovative and scalable quality improvement interventions are needed to strengthen health systems and reduce avoidable child mortality.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Rehabilitation services aim to optimise individuals’ functioning and reduce disability. However, people with disabilities, who represent a key population of users of rehabilitation services, continue to have unmet needs for rehabilitation services that include the provision of assistive devices. This paper examines the availability and accessibility of rehabilitation services in a rural district of South Africa in order to explore why unmet needs for rehabilitation services persist. Methods: All nine district hospitals in a rural district of South Africa were included in the study. Rehabilitation services capacity was assessed by examining the available assistive devices, consumables and human resources at the level of the health facility. Data collection was conducted using the Global Co-operative Assistive Technology [GATE] Assistive Products List, AT2030’s ATScale priority list and the South African National Catalogue of Commodities for Primary Health Care Facilities. Descriptive statistics were then used for the analysis. For the qualitative component, semi-structured interviews were conducted with adults with physical disabilities at household level to explore barriers to accessing assistive device inclusive rehabilitation services and the consequences thereof in the same rural district. An interview guide based on the WHO health system building blocks was used. Thematic content analysis guided the analysis of the interview transcripts. Findings: The findings of the research demonstrate that rehabilitation service capacity in the district was constrained as a result of low availability of assistive devices [2–22\%] and consumables [2–47\%], as well as, possibly, a shortage of rehabilitation providers [n = 30] with an unequal distribution across health facilities [n = 9]. In addition, people with physical disabilities reported poor referral pathways, financial constraints, transport and road consideration and equipment unavailability as barriers to accessing rehabilitation services. Moreover, these barriers to access predisposed individuals to finance-, health- and person-related harm. Conclusion: Rehabilitation service availability is constrained by a lack of service capacity in rural South Africa. In addition, the rehabilitation services in district hospitals are not adequately accessible because of existing barriers to enable key populations to achieve optimised functioning.},

Primary health care (PHC) settings in countries like Malawi and Zambia could be a doorway to effectively manage NCDs by moving away from delivering only episodic care to providing an integrated approach over time. As part of a collaborative health system strengthening project, we assessed and compared the preparedness and operational capacity of two target networks of public PHC settings in Lilongwe (Malawi) and Lusaka (Zambia) to integrate NCD services within routine service delivery. Data was collected and analyzed using validated health facility survey tools. These baseline assessments conducted between August 2018 and March 2019, also included interviews with 20 on-site health personnel and focal persons, who described existing barriers in delivering NCD services. In both countries, policy directives to decentralize disease-specific NCD services to the primary care level were initiated to meet increased demand but lacked operational guidance. In general, the assessed PHC sites were inadequately prepared to integrate NCDs into various service delivery domains, thus requiring further support. In spite of existing multi-faceted limitations, there was motivation among healthcare staff to provide NCD services.},

              Background
              Provider-initiated HIV testing and counseling (PITC) is a recommended approach to screen for HIV to all pregnant women during antenatal care (ANC) visits, and all with HIV positive results have to be enrolled into prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) program. However, little is known about the relationship between facility readiness and the uptake of PITC to pregnant women attending ANC in Tanzania. Therefore, this study assessed whether the facility readiness promotes the uptake of PITC to the pregnant women attending ANC for the purpose of improving the PMTCT interventions in Tanzania.
            
            
              Methods
              
                This study analyzed data for health facilities obtained from the 2014–2015 Tanzania service provision assessment survey. The Primary outcome measure was a composite variable (with score of 0–5) in which its higher scores indicates provision of high-quality of PITC. Also, facilities scored higher in the PMTCT service readiness index were considered to have high readiness to provide PMTCT services. In Poisson regression analyses, a series of models were fitted to assess whether there is an association between provision of high-quality of PITC and facility readiness. In all statistical analysis, a
                P
                 {\textless} 0.05 was considered significant.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Out of 1853 included first-visit ANC consultations, only about one-third of pregnant women received all five components required for PITC. The mean percentage of PMTCT readiness score was moderate 63.96 [61.32–66.59]\%. In adjusted model, we found that facility with high readiness to provide PMTCT services was significantly associated with the provision of high-quality of PITC (model 2: [β = 0.075,
                P
                 = 0.00]).
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              In order to increase high-quality of PITC services, efforts should be made to improve the PMTCT facility readiness by increasing availability of trained staffs, diagnostic tools, and ARTs among health facilities in Tanzania.},

	abstract = {Background
              Actionable information about the readiness of health facilities is needed to inform quality improvement efforts in maternity care, but there is no consensus on the best approach to measure readiness. Many countries use the WHO’s Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) or the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) Programme’s Service Provision Assessment to measure facility readiness. This study compares measures of childbirth service readiness based on SARA and DHS guidance to an index based on WHO’s quality of maternal and newborn care standards.
            
            
              Methods
              We used cross-sectional data from Performance Monitoring for Action Ethiopia’s 2019 survey of 406 health facilities providing childbirth services. We calculated childbirth service readiness scores using items based on SARA, DHS and WHO standards. For each, we used three aggregation methods for generating indices: simple addition, domain-weighted addition and principal components analysis. We compared central tendency, spread and item variation between the readiness indices; concordance between health facility scores and rankings; and correlations between readiness scores and delivery volume.
            
            
              Results
              Indices showed moderate agreement with one another, and all had a small but significant positive correlation with monthly delivery volume. Ties were more frequent for indices with fewer items. More than two-thirds of items in the relatively shorter SARA and DHS indices were widely ({\textgreater}90\%) available in hospitals, and half of the SARA items were widely ({\textgreater}90\%) available in health centres/clinics. Items based on the WHO standards showed greater variation and captured unique aspects of readiness (eg, quality improvement processes, actionable information systems) not included in either the SARA or DHS indices.
            
            
              Conclusion
              SARA and DHS indices rely on a small set of widely available items to assess facility readiness to provide childbirth care. Expanded selection of items based on the WHO standards can better differentiate between levels of service readiness.},

            Postabortion care (PAC) is an essential component of emergency obstetric care (EmOC) and is necessary to prevent unsafe abortion-related maternal mortality, but we know little regarding the preparedness of facilities to provide PAC services, the distribution of these services and disparities in their accessibility in low-resource settings. To address this knowledge gap, this study aims to describe PAC service availability, evaluate PAC readiness and measure inequities in access to PAC services in seven states of Nigeria and nationally in Côte d’Ivoire. We used survey data from reproductive-age women and the health facilities that serve the areas where they live. We linked facility readiness information, including PAC-specific signal functions, to female data using geospatial information. Findings revealed less than half of facilities provide basic PAC services in Nigeria (48.4\%) but greater PAC availability in Côte d’Ivoire (70.5\%). Only 33.5\% and 36.9\% of facilities with the capacity to provide basic PAC and only 23.9\% and 37.5\% of facilities with the capacity to provide comprehensive PAC had all the corresponding signal functions in Nigeria and Côte d’Ivoire, respectively. With regard to access, while ∼8 out of 10 women of reproductive age in Nigeria (81.3\%) and Côte d’Ivoire (79.9\%) lived within 10 km of a facility providing any PAC services, significantly lower levels of the population lived \&lt;10 km from a facility with all basic or comprehensive PAC signal functions, and we observed significant inequities in access for poor, rural and less educated women. Addressing facilities’ service readiness will improve the quality of PAC provided and ensure postabortion complications can be treated in a timely and effective manner, while expanding the availability of services to additional primary-level facilities would increase access—both of which could help to reduce avoidable abortion-related maternal morbidity and mortality and associated inequities.},

              Background
              Infrastructure development and upgrading to support safe surgical services in primary health care facilities is an important step in the journey towards achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Quality health service provision together with equitable geographic access and service delivery are important components that constitute UHC. Tanzania has been investing in infrastructure development to offer essential safe surgery close to communities at affordable costs while ensuring better outcomes. This study aimed to understand the public sector’s efforts to improve the infrastructure of primary health facilities between 2005 and 2019. We assessed the construction rates, geographic coverage, and physical status of each facility, surgical safety and services rendered in public primary health facilities.
            
            
              Methods
              Data was collected from existing policy reports, the Services Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) tool (physical status), the Health Facility Registry (HFR), implementation reports on infrastructure development from the 26 regions and 185 district councils across the country (covering assessment of physical infrastructure, waste management systems and inventories for ambulances) and Comprehensive Emergence Obstetric Care (CEMONC) signal functions assessment tool. Data was descriptively analyzed so as to understand the distribution of primary health care facilities and their status (old, new, upgraded, under construction, renovated and equipped), and the service provided, including essential surgical services.
            
            
              Results
              Of 5072 (518 are Health Centers and 4554 are Dispensaries) existing public primary health care facilities, the majority (46\%) had a physical status of A (good state), 33\% (1693) had physical status of B (minor renovation needed) and the remaining facilities had physical status of C up to F (needing major renovation). About 33\% (1673) of all health facilities had piped water and 5.1\% had landline telecommunication system. Between 2015 and August 2019, a total of 419 (8.3\%) health facilities (Consisting of 350 health centers and 69 District Council Hospitals) were either renovated or constructed and equipped to offer safe surgery services. Of all Health Centers only 115 (22.2\%) were offering the CEMONC services. Of these 115 health facilities, only 20 (17.4\%) were offering the CEMONC services with all 9 - signal functions and only 17.4\% had facilities that are offering safe blood transfusion services.
            
            
              Conclusion
              This study indicates that between 2015 and 2019 there has been improvement in physical status of primary health facilities as a result constructions, upgrading and equipping the facilities to offer safe surgery and related diagnostic services. Despite the achievements, still there is a high demand for good physical statuses and functioning of primary health facilities with capacity to offer essential and safe surgical services in the country also as an important strategy towards achieving UHC. This is also inline with the National Surgical, Obstetrics and Anesthesia plan (NSOAP).},

            Tanzanian youth have high levels of HIV risk and poor access to HIV-testing. Oral self-implemented testing (Oral-SIT) provides an alternative that reduces barriers to HIV-testing. We examined adaptations to Oral-SIT training components in a randomized experiment to evaluate a “train-the-trainer” strategy for improving comprehension of graphic training materials. Participants (N = 257, age = 14−19 years) were randomly assigned to one of two self-training conditions: graphic instruction book (GIB) or Video-GIB. Outcomes included behavioral performance fidelity, self-reported comprehension, and intentions to seek treatment. Video-GIB participants, relative to GIB-only participants, had higher performance fidelity scores, made fewer performance errors, had better instruction comprehension, and were more likely to intend to seek treatment. Oral-SIT timing errors were significantly more common among GIB-only participants.
            Graphic training materials in conjunction with a “train-the-trainer” video has significant potential for increasing Oral-SIT’s reach by overcoming technological and literacy barriers.},

	abstract = {Background
              Malawi has halved the neonatal mortality rate between 1990–2018, however, is not on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 12 per 1,000 live births. Despite a high facility birth rate (91\%), mother-newborn dyads may not remain in facilities long enough to receive recommended care and quality of care improvements are needed to reach global targets. Physical access and distance to health facilities remain barriers to quality postnatal care.
            
            
              Methods
              Using data We used individual data from the 2015–16 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey and facility data from the 2013–14 Malawi Service Provision Assessment, linking households to all health facilities within specified distances and travel times. We calculated service readiness scores for facilities to measure their capacity to provide birth/newborn care services. We fitted multi-level regression models to evaluate the association between the service readiness and appropriate newborn care (receiving at least five of six interventions).
            
            
              Results
              Households with recent births (n = 6010) linked to a median of two birth facilities within 5–10 km and one facility within a two-hour walk. The maximum service environment scores for linked facilities median was 77.5 for facilities within 5–10 km and 75.5 for facilities within a two-hour walk. While linking to one or more facilities within 5-10km or a two-hour walk was not associated with appropriate newborn care, higher levels of service readiness in nearby facilities was associated with an increased risk of appropriate newborn care.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Women’s choice of nearby facilities and quality facilities is limited. High quality newborn care is sub-optimal despite high coverage of facility birth and some newborn care interventions. While we did not find proximity to more facilities was associated with increased risk of appropriate care, high levels of service readiness was, showing facility birth and improved access to well-prepared facilities are important for improving newborn care.},

	abstract = {Background:
              The effective performance of hospitals is critical to overall health system goal achievement. Global health system performance frameworks are often used as part of global benchmarking, but not within low and middle-income countries as part of service delivery performance measurement. This study explored the utility of perinatal mortality as a measure of hospital effectiveness.
            
            
              Methods:
              A cross sectional, mixed methods study of six primary referral hospitals, differentiated by ownership, was conducted from 10th June to 9th October 2015. Monthly summary hospital data of maternal delivery services (MDS) were abstracted to determine the perinatal mortality. Tests of associations were used to correlate bed turnover, skilled staffing, method of delivery and perinatal mortality. Additionally, 40 questionnaire interviews were held with hospital board members and the management team to assess the availability of standard operating procedures (SOP) in MDS. Qualitative data was analysed thematically.
            
            
              Results:
              All six hospitals reported having SOP in managing MDS. The average perinatal mortality rate for all the hospitals was 24.63 per 1,000 live births. However, a perinatal death was 2.6 times more likely in public hospitals compared to private hospitals (29.8 vs 11.4 per 1,000 births respectively). The average caesarean section rate for all hospitals was 25.9\%, but the odds of a caesarean section were 1.67 higher in a private hospital compared to a public hospital (P{\textless}0.001 95\% CI: 1.58-1.77). Perinatal mortality was associated with bed turnover ratio (R squared 0.260, P=0.001), and skilled staff availability (R squared 0.064,P{\textless}0.001).
            
            
              Discussion:
              The high perinatal mortality reported in public hospitals may be due to high bed turnover and relatively low caesarean section rate. Input measures of performance such as reporting standards of care and staffing levels are not useful performance indicators. Perinatal mortality as a performance indicator may be an ideal measure of the effectiveness of hospitals.},

              Background
              When Service Provision Assessment (SPA) surveys on primary health service delivery are combined with the nationally representative household survey—Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), they can provide key information on the access, utilization, and equity of health service availability in low- and middle-income countries. However, existing linkage methods have been established only at aggregate levels due to known limitations of the survey datasets.
            
            
              Methods
              For the linkage of two data sets at a disaggregated level, we developed a geostatistical approach where SPA limitations are explicitly accounted for by identifying the sites where health facilities might be present but not included in SPA surveys. Using the knowledge gained from SPA surveys related to the contextual information around facilities and their spatial structure, we made an inference on the service environment of unsampled health facilities. The geostatistical linkage results on the availability of health service were validated using two criteria—prediction accuracy and classification error. We also assessed the effect of displacement of DHS clusters on the linkage results using simulation.
            
            
              Results
              The performance evaluation of the geostatistical linkage method, demonstrated using information on the general service readiness of sampled health facilities in Tanzania, showed that the proposed methods exceeded the performance of the existing methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and classification error. We also found that the geostatistical linkage methods are more robust than existing methods with respect to the displacement of DHS clusters.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The proposed geospatial approach minimizes the methodological issues and has potential to be used in various public health research applications where facility and population-based data need to be combined at fine spatial scale.},

              Background
              With the 40th anniversary of the Declaration of Alma-Ata, a global effort is underway to re-focus on strengthening primary health care systems, with emphasis on leveraging community health workers (CHWs) towards the goal of achieving universal health coverage for all. Institutionalizing effective, sustainable community health systems is currently limited by a lack of standard metrics for measuring CHW performance and the systems they work within. Developed through iterative consultations, supported by the Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation and in partnership with USAID and UNICEF, this paper details a framework, list of indicators, and measurement considerations for monitoring CHW performance in low- and middle-income countries.
            
            
              Methods
              A review of peer-reviewed articles, reports, and global data collection tools was conducted to identify key measurement domains in monitoring CHW performance. Three consultations were successively convened with global stakeholders, community health implementers, advocates, measurement experts, and Ministry of Health representatives using a modified Delphi approach to build consensus on priority indicators. During this process, a structured, web-based survey was administered to identify the importance and value of specific measurement domains, sub-domains, and indicators determined through the literature reviews and initial stakeholder consultations. Indicators with more than 75\% support from participants were further refined with expert qualitative input.
            
            
              Results
              Twenty-one sub-domains for measurement were identified including measurement of incentives for CHWs, supervision and performance appraisal, data use, data reporting, service delivery, quality of services, CHW absenteeism and attrition, community use of services, experience of services, referral/counter-referral, credibility/trust, and programmatic costs. Forty-six indicators were agreed upon to measure the sub-domains. In the absence of complete population enumeration and digitized health information systems, the quality of metrics to monitor CHW programs is limited.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Better data collection approaches at the community level are needed to strengthen management of CHW programs and community health systems. The proposed list of metrics balances exhaustive and pragmatic measurement of CHW performance within primary healthcare systems. Adoption of the proposed framework and associated indicators by CHW program implementors may improve programmatic effectiveness, strengthen their accountability to national community health systems, drive programmatic quality improvement, and plausibly improve the impact of these programs.},

              Background
              Nepal has improved access and utilisation of routine maternal and newborn health (MNH) services. Despite improved access to routine MNH services such as antenatal care (ANC), and delivery and postnatal care (PNC) services, the burden of maternal and neonatal deaths in Nepal remains high. Most of those deaths could be prevented by improving utilisation of evidence-informed clinical MNH interventions. However, little is known on determinants of utilisation of such clinical MNH interventions in health facilities (HFs). This study investigated the determinants of utilisation of technical quality MNH services in Nepal.
            
            
              Methods
              
                This study used data from the 2015 Nepal Services Provision Assessment. A total of 523 pregnant and 309 postpartum women were included for the analysis of utilisation of technical quality of ANC, and delivery and PNC services, respectively. Outcome variables were utilisation of better quality i) ANC services, and ii) delivery and PNC services while independent variables included features of HFs and health workers, and demographic characteristics of pregnant and postpartum women. Binomial logistic regression was conducted to identify the determinants associated with utilisation of quality MNH services. The odds ratio with 95\% confidence interval (CIs) were reported at the significance level of
                p
                 {\textless} 0.05 (two-tailed).
              
            
            
              Results
              Women utilised quality ANC services if they attended facilities with better HF capacity (aOR = 2.12;95\% CI: 1.03, 4.35). Women utilised better quality delivery and PNC services from private HFs compared to public HFs (aOR = 2.63; 95\% CI: 1.14, 6.08). Women utilised better technical quality ANC provided by nursing staff compared to physicians (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) =2.89; 95\% CI: 1.33, 6.29), and from staff supervised by a higher authority compared to those not supervised (aOR = 1.71; 95\% CI: 1.01, 2.92). However, compared to province one, women utilised poor quality delivery and PNC services from HFs in province two (aOR = 0.15; 95\% CI: 0.03, 0.63).
            
            
              Conclusions
              Women utilised quality MNH services at facilities with better HF capacity, service provided by nursing staff, and attended at supervised HFs/health workers. Provincial and municipal governments require strengthening HF capacities (e.g., supply equipment, medicines, supplies), recruiting trained nurse-midwives, and supervising health workers.},

              Background
              In sub-Saharan Africa, women are most likely to receive skilled and adequate childbirth care in hospital settings, yet the use of hospital for childbirth is low and inequitable. The poorest and those living furthest away from a hospital are most affected. But the relative contribution of poverty and travel time is convoluted, since hospitals are often located in wealthier urban places and are scarcer in poorer remote area. This study aims to partition the variability in hospital-based childbirth by poverty and travel time in four sub-Saharan African countries.
            
            
              Methods
              We used data from the most recent Demographic and Health Survey in Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria and Tanzania. For each country, geographic coordinates of survey clusters, the master list of hospital locations and a high-resolution map of land surface friction were used to estimate travel time from each DHS cluster to the nearest hospital with a shortest-path algorithm. We quantified and compared the predicted probabilities of hospital-based childbirth resulting from one standard deviation (SD) change around the mean for different model predictors.
            
            
              Results
              The mean travel time to the nearest hospital, in minutes, was 27 (Kenya), 31 (Malawi), 25 (Nigeria) and 62 (Tanzania). In Kenya, a change of 1SD in wealth led to a 33.2 percentage points change in the probability of hospital birth, whereas a 1SD change in travel time led to a change of 16.6 percentage points. The marginal effect of 1SD change in wealth was weaker than that of travel time in Malawi (13.1 vs. 34.0 percentage points) and Tanzania (20.4 vs. 33.7 percentage points). In Nigeria, the two were similar (22.3 vs. 24.8 percentage points) but their additive effect was twice stronger (44.6 percentage points) than the separate effects. Random effects from survey clusters also explained substantial variability in hospital-based childbirth in all countries, indicating other unobserved local factors at play.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Both poverty and long travel time are important determinants of hospital birth, although they vary in the extent to which they influence whether women give birth in a hospital within and across countries. This suggests that different strategies are needed to effectively enable poor women and women living in remote areas to gain access to skilled and adequate care for childbirth.},

	abstract = {One of the major contributors of malaria-related deaths in Sub-Saharan African countries is the limited accessibility to quality care. In these countries, malaria control activities are implemented at the health-district level (operational entity of the national health system), while malaria readiness indicators are regionally representative. This study provides an approach for estimating health district-level malaria readiness indicators from survey data designed to provide regionally representative estimates. A binomial-hierarchical Bayesian spatial prediction method was applied to Burkina Faso Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) survey data to provide estimates of essential equipment availability and readiness for malaria care. Predicted values of each indicator were adjusted by the type of health facility, location, and population density. Then, a health district composite readiness profile was built via hierarchical ascendant classification. All surveyed health-facilities were mandated by the Ministry of Health to manage malaria cases. The spatial distribution of essential equipment and malaria readiness was heterogeneous. Around 62.9\% of health districts had a high level of readiness to provide malaria care and prevention during pregnancy. Low-performance scores for managing malaria cases were found in big cities. Health districts with low coverage for both first-line antimalarial drugs and rapid diagnostic tests were Baskuy, Bogodogo, Boulmiougou, Nongr-Massoum, Sig-Nonghin, Dafra, and Do. We provide health district estimates and reveal gaps in basic equipment and malaria management resources in some districts that need to be filled. By providing local-scale estimates, this approach could be replicated for other types of indicators to inform decision makers and health program managers and to identify priority areas.},

              Background
              Accessibility and utilization of antenatal care (ANC) service varies depending on different geographical locations, sociodemographic characteristics, political and other factors. A geographically linked data analysis using population and health facility data is valuable to map ANC use, and identify inequalities in service access and provision. Thus, this study aimed to assess the spatial patterns of ANC use, and to identify associated factors among pregnant women in Ethiopia.
            
            
              Method
              A secondary data analysis of the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey linked with the 2014 Ethiopian Service Provision Assessment was conducted. A multilevel analysis was carried out using the SAS GLIMMIX procedure. Furthermore, hot spot analysis and spatial regressions were carried out to identify the hot spot areas of and factors associated with the spatial variations in ANC use using ArcGIS and R softwares.
            
            
              Results
              A one-unit increase in the mean score of ANC service availability in a typical region was associated with a five-fold increase in the odds of having more ANC visits. Moreover, every one-kilometre increase in distance to the nearest ANC facility in a typical region was negatively associated with having at least four ANC visits. Twenty-five percent of the variability in having at least four ANC visits was accounted for by region of living. The spatial analysis found that the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples region had high clusters of at least four ANC visits. Furthermore, the coefficients of having the first ANC visit during the first trimester were estimated to have spatial variations in the use of at least four ANC visits.
            
            
              Conclusion
              There were significant variations in the use of ANC services across the different regions of Ethiopia. Region of living and distance were key drivers of ANC use underscoring the need for increased ANC availability, particularly in the cold spot regions.},

              Background
              The Service Availability and Readiness Assessment surveys generate data on the readiness of health facility services. We constructed a readiness index related to malaria services and determined the association between health facility malaria readiness and malaria mortality in children under the age of 5 years in Burkina Faso.
            
            
              Methods
              Data on inpatients visits and malaria-related deaths in under 5-year-old children were extracted from the national Health Management Information System in Burkina Faso. Bayesian geostatistical models with variable selection were fitted to malaria mortality data. The most important facility readiness indicators related to general and malaria-specific services were determined. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was employed to construct a composite facility readiness score based on multiple factorial axes. The analysis was carried out separately for 112 medical centres and 546 peripheral health centres.
            
            
              Results
              
                Malaria mortality rate in medical centres was 4.8 times higher than that of peripheral health centres (3.5\% vs. 0.7\%,
                p
                 {\textless} 0.0001). Essential medicines was the domain with the lowest readiness (only 0.1\% of medical centres and 0\% of peripheral health centres had the whole set of tracer items of essential medicines). Basic equipment readiness was the highest. The composite readiness score explained 30 and 53\% of the original set of items for medical centres and peripheral health centres, respectively. Mortality rate ratio (MRR) was by 59\% (MRR = 0.41, 95\% Bayesian credible interval: 0.19–0.91) lower in the high readiness group of peripheral health centres, compared to the low readiness group. Medical centres readiness was not related to malaria mortality. The geographical distribution of malaria mortality rate indicate that regions with health facilities with high readiness show lower mortality rates.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Performant health services in Burkina Faso are associated with lower malaria mortality rates. Health system readiness should be strengthened in the regions of Sahel, Sud-Ouest and Boucle du Mouhoun. Emphasis should be placed on improving the management of essential medicines and to reducing delays of emergency transportation between the different levels of the health system.},

              Objective
              The objective of this study was to evaluate the tuberculosis (TB) health system capacity and its variations by location and types of health facilities in Ethiopia.
            
            
              Design
              We used the Service Provision Assessment plus (SPA+) survey data that were collected in 2014 in all hospitals and randomly selected health centers and private facilities in all regions of Ethiopia. We assessed structural, process and overall health system capacity based on the Donabedian quality of care model. Multiple linear regression and spatial analysis were done to assess TB capacity score variation across regions.
            
            
              Setting
              The study included 873 public and private health facilities all over Ethiopia.
            
            
              Participants

              Results
              A total of 873 health facilities were included in the analysis. The overall TB care capacity score was 76.7\%, 55.9\% and 37.8\% in public hospitals, health centers and private facilities, respectively. The health system capacity score for TB was higher in the urban (60.4\%) facilities compared to that of the rural (50.0\%) facilities (β = 8.0, 95\% CI: 4.4, 11.6). Health centers (β = −16.2, 95\% CI: −20.0, −12.3) and private health facilities (β = −38.3, 95\% CI: −42.4, −35.1) had lower TB care capacity score than hospitals. Overall TB care capacity score were lower in Western and Southwestern Ethiopia and in Benishangul-Gumuz and Gambella regions.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The health system capacity score for TB care in Ethiopia varied across regions. Health system capacity improvement interventions should focus on the private sectors and health facilities in the rural and remote areas to ensure equity and improve quality of care.},

              Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey data linked to Service Provision Assessment data.
            
            
              Population
              8473 married women and 1020 facilities that reported providing family planning services.
            
            
              Methods
              A linked secondary data analysis of population and health facility data was carried out. Both multilevel and spatial analyses were conducted to identify key determinants of women’s use of modern contraceptive and spatial clustering of modern contraceptive use.
            
            
              Main outcome measure
              Modern contraceptive use.
            
            
              Results
              About 24\% of the variation in the use of modern contraception was accounted for by location. A one-unit increase in the mean score of health facilities’ readiness to provide short-term modern contraceptives in a typical region was associated with a 20-fold increase in the odds of modern contraceptive use (adjusted OR (AOR) 20.49, 95\% CI 1.44 to 29.54). In the spatial analysis, it was found that Addis Ababa and the Amhara region had high clusters of modern contraceptive use rates. On the other hand, low rates of contraceptive use were clustered in the Afar and Somali regions.
            
            
              Conclusion
              There were significant variations in the use of modern contraceptives across the different regions of Ethiopia. Therefore, regions with low contraceptive rates and high fertility rates should be targeted for scaling up and tailoring of services to the culture and lifestyles of the population of those regions.},

              Background
              Both availability and quality of family planning services are believed to have contributed to increasing contraceptive use and declining fertility rates in developing countries. Yet, there is limited empirical evidence to show the relationship between the quality of family planning services and the population based prevalence of contraceptive methods. This study examined the relationship between quality of family planning services and use of intrauterine devices (IUD) in Egypt.
            
            
              Methods
              
                The analysis used data from the 2003 Egypt Interim Demographic and Health Survey (EIDHS) that included 8,445 married women aged 15–49, and the 2002 Egypt Service Provision Assessment (ESPA) survey that included 602 facilities offering family planning services. The EIDHS collected latitude and longitude coordinates of all sampled clusters, and the ESPA collected these coordinates for all sampled facilities. Using Geographic Information System (GIS) methods, individual women were linked to a facility located within 10 km of their community. A facility-level index was constructed to reflect the quality of family planning services. Four dimensions of quality of care were examined: counseling, examination room, supply of contraceptive methods, and management. Effects of quality of family planning services on the use of IUD and other contraceptive methods were estimated using multinomial logistic regression. Results are presented as relative risk ratios (RRR) with significance levels (
                p
                -values).
              
            
            
              Results
              
                IUD use among women who obtained their method from public sources was significantly positively associated with quality of family planning services (RRR = 1.36,
                p
                {\textless} 0.01), independent of distance to the facility, facility type, age, number of living children, education level, household wealth status, and residence. Quality of services related to counseling and examination room had strong positive effects on use of IUD (RRR = 1.61 for counseling and RRR = 1.46 for examination room). Obtaining IUD from a private source or using other contraceptive methods was not associated with quality of services.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              This study is one among the few that used geographic information to link data from a population-based survey with an independently sampled health facility survey. The findings demonstrate that service quality is an important determinant of use of clinical contraceptive methods in Egypt. Improving quality of family planning services may help further increase use of clinical contraceptive methods and reduce fertility.},

              This study linked data from the 2012 Haiti Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and the 2013 Haiti Service Provision Assessment (SPA) to estimate the extent to which women’s contraceptive use is associated with the method choices available in Haiti’s health facilities.
            
            
              Methods
              Using Global Positioning System (GPS) data for DHS clusters and for health facilities, we linked each DHS cluster to all of the family planning facilities located within a specified distance, and then measured the cluster’s level of contraceptive method choice based on the number of facilities within the buffer zone that offered three or more modern contraceptive methods. Random intercept logistic regressions were used to model the variation in individual modern contraceptive use and the availability of multiple method choices at the cluster level.
            
            
              Results
              Limited number of family planning facilities in Haiti offered at least three modern contraceptive methods (51\% in urban and 23\% in rural). Seventeen percent of both rural and urban women lived in an area with low availability of multiple methods—meaning that no facility in the specified buffer zone offered three or more contraceptive methods. Another 29\% of rural women and 41\% of urban women had medium availability—that is, only one facility in the buffer zone offered three or more methods. In rural areas, compared with women living in a cluster with low availability of multiple methods, the odds of using a modern method are 73\% higher for women living in a cluster with medium availability, and over twice as high for women living in a cluster with high availability. A similar positive relationship was also found in urban areas.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Women in Haiti have only limited proximity to a health facility offering a variety of contraceptive methods. Improving access to a range of methods available at health facilities near where people live is critical for increasing contraceptive use in both urban and rural areas of Haiti.},

Goal number five aimed to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters and provide universal access to reproductive healthcare services by 2015. While there has been some progress, MDG 5 fell far short of target goals, highlighting the necessity of further improvement in global maternal health. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), this study aims to understand how distance to facility and quality of care, which are components of access, affect maternal service utilization in two of the world’s poorest countries, Haiti and Kenya. Furthermore, this study examines how this relationship may change or hold between urban and rural regions. Data from the United States Agency for International Development Demographic and Health Survey and Service Provision Assessment were linked spatially in a GIS model, drawing comparisons among distance to facility, quality of care, and maternal health service utilization. Results show that in both rural and urban regions, access to maternal health service and maternal health service utilization share a similar spatial pattern. In urban regions, pockets of maternal health disparities exist despite close distance to facility and standard quality of care. In rural regions, there are areas with long distances to facilities and low quality of care, resulting in poor maternal service usage. This study highlights the usefulness of GIS as a tool to evaluate disparities in maternal healthcare provision and usage.},

              Background
              This study explored the role of health facility availability as it relates to maternal and newborn PNC use in rural Malawi.
            
            
              Methods
              Malawi Demographic and Health Survey (MDHS) 2015–16 data, MDHS 2015–16 household cluster GPS data, Malawi Service Provision Assessment (MSPA) 2013–14 data and MSPA 2013–14 facility GPS data were used. Household clusters were spatially linked with facilities using buffers. Descriptive analyses were performed and generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to determine the effects of having different types of facilities at varying distances from household clusters on receipt of maternal and newborn PNC in rural Malawi.
            
            
              Results
              In rural Malawi, around 96\% of women had facilities providing PNC within 10 km of where they live. Among women who have clinic-level facilities within 5 km of where they live, around 25\% had clinic-level facilities that provide PNC. For rural women who gave birth in the past 5 years preceding the survey, only about 3\% received maternal PNC within 24 h and about 16\% received maternal PNC within the first week. As for newborn PNC, 3\% of newborns had PNC within 24 h and about 26\% had newborn PNC within the first week. PNC mostly took place at facilities (94\% for women and 95\% for newborns). For women who delivered at home, having a health center providing PNC within 5 km was positively associated with maternal and newborn PNC. For women who delivered at facilities, having a health center providing PNC within 5 km was positively associated with maternal PNC and having a health center providing PNC between 5 km and 10 km was positively associated with both maternal and newborn PNC. Regardless of the place of delivery and distance band, having a clinic-level facility providing PNC did not have significant positive effects on maternal and newborn PNC.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Providers should be trained to perform quality PNC at all facilities. It would also be important to address concerns related to health workers. Lastly, it would be key to increase community awareness about the importance of seeking timely PNC and about the utility of lower-level facilities for receiving preventative PNC.},

              Background
              Accessibility and utilization of antenatal care (ANC) service varies depending on different geographical locations, sociodemographic characteristics, political and other factors. A geographically linked data analysis using population and health facility data is valuable to map ANC use, and identify inequalities in service access and provision. Thus, this study aimed to assess the spatial patterns of ANC use, and to identify associated factors among pregnant women in Ethiopia.
            
            
              Method
              A secondary data analysis of the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey linked with the 2014 Ethiopian Service Provision Assessment was conducted. A multilevel analysis was carried out using the SAS GLIMMIX procedure. Furthermore, hot spot analysis and spatial regressions were carried out to identify the hot spot areas of and factors associated with the spatial variations in ANC use using ArcGIS and R softwares.
            
            
              Results
              A one-unit increase in the mean score of ANC service availability in a typical region was associated with a five-fold increase in the odds of having more ANC visits. Moreover, every one-kilometre increase in distance to the nearest ANC facility in a typical region was negatively associated with having at least four ANC visits. Twenty-five percent of the variability in having at least four ANC visits was accounted for by region of living. The spatial analysis found that the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples region had high clusters of at least four ANC visits. Furthermore, the coefficients of having the first ANC visit during the first trimester were estimated to have spatial variations in the use of at least four ANC visits.
            
            
              Conclusion
              There were significant variations in the use of ANC services across the different regions of Ethiopia. Region of living and distance were key drivers of ANC use underscoring the need for increased ANC availability, particularly in the cold spot regions.},

	abstract = {Objective
              Increasing the availability of basic healthcare services in low-and middle-income countries is not sufficient to meet the Sustainable Development Goal target for child survival in high-mortality settings, where healthcare utilisation is often inconsistent and quality of care can be poor. We assessed whether poor quality of sick child healthcare in Malawi is associated with low utilisation of sick child healthcare.
            
            
              Design
              We measured two elements of quality of sick child healthcare: facility structural readiness and process of care using data from the 2013 Malawi Service Provision Assessment. Overall quality was defined as the average of these metrics. We extracted demographic data from the 2013–2014 Malawi Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey and linked households to nearby facilities using geocodes. We used logistic regression to examine the association of facility quality with utilisation of formal health services for children under 5 years of age suffering diarrhoea, fever or cough/acute respiratory illness, controlling for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. We conducted sensitivity analyses (SAs), modifying the travel distance and population—facility matching criteria.
            
            
              Setting and population
              568 facilities were linked with 9701 children with recent illness symptoms in Malawi, of whom 69\% had been brought to a health facility.
            
            
              Results
              Overall, facilities showed gaps in structural quality (62\% readiness) and major deficiencies in process quality (33\%), for an overall quality score of 48\%. Better facility quality was associated with higher odds of utilisation of sick child healthcare services (adjusted ORs (AOR): 1.66, 95\% CI: 1.04 to 2.63), as was structural quality alone (AOR: 1.33, 95\% CI: 0.95 to 1.87). SAs supported the main finding.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Although Malawi’s health facilities for curative child care are widely available, quality and utilisation of sick child healthcare services are in short supply. Improving facility quality may provide a way to encourage higher utilisation of healthcare, thereby decreasing preventable childhood morbidity and mortality.},

In these countries, malaria control activities are implemented at the health-district level (operational entity of the national health system), while malaria readiness indicators are regionally representative. This study provides an approach for estimating health district-level malaria readiness indicators from survey data designed to provide regionally representative estimates. A binomial-hierarchical Bayesian spatial prediction method was applied to Burkina Faso Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) survey data to provide estimates of essential equipment availability and readiness for malaria care. Predicted values of each indicator were adjusted by the type of health facility, location, and population density. Then, a health district composite readiness profile was built via hierarchical ascendant classification. All surveyed health-facilities were mandated by the Ministry of Health to manage malaria cases. The spatial distribution of essential equipment and malaria readiness was heterogeneous. Around 62.9\% of health districts had a high level of readiness to provide malaria care and prevention during pregnancy. Low-performance scores for managing malaria cases were found in big cities. Health districts with low coverage for both first-line antimalarial drugs and rapid diagnostic tests were Baskuy, Bogodogo, Boulmiougou, Nongr-Massoum, Sig-Nonghin, Dafra, and Do. We provide health district estimates and reveal gaps in basic equipment and malaria management resources in some districts that need to be filled. By providing local-scale estimates, this approach could be replicated for other types of indicators to inform decision makers and health program managers and to identify priority areas.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              Increases in facility deliveries in sub-Saharan Africa have not yielded expected declines in maternal mortality, raising concerns about the quality of care provided in facilities. The readiness of facilities at different health system levels to provide both emergency obstetric and newborn care (EmONC) as well as referral is unknown. We describe this combined readiness by facility level and region in Senegal.
            
            
              Methods
              For this cross-sectional study, we used data from nine Demographic and Health Surveys between 1992 and 2017 in Senegal to describe trends in location of births over time. We used data from the 2017 Service Provision Assessment to describe EmONC and emergency referral readiness across facility levels in the public system, where 94\% of facility births occur. A national global positioning system facility census was used to map access from lower-level facilities to the nearest facility performing caesareans.
            
            
              Results
              Births in facilities increased from 47\% in 1992 to 80\% in 2016, driven by births in lower-level health posts, where half of facility births now occur. Caesarean rates in rural areas more than doubled but only to 3.7\%, indicating minor improvements in EmONC access. Only 9\% of health posts had full readiness for basic EmONC, and 62\% had adequate referral readiness (vehicle on-site or telephone and vehicle access elsewhere). Although public facilities accounted for three-quarters of all births in 2016, only 16\% of such births occurred in facilities able to provide adequate combined readiness for EmONC and referral.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our findings imply that many lower-level public facilities—the most common place of birth in Senegal—are unable to treat or refer women with obstetric complications, especially in rural areas. In light of rising lower-level facility births in Senegal and elsewhere, improvements in EmONC and referral readiness are urgently needed to accelerate reductions in maternal and perinatal mortality.},

              Background
              Accessibility and utilization of antenatal care (ANC) service varies depending on different geographical locations, sociodemographic characteristics, political and other factors. A geographically linked data analysis using population and health facility data is valuable to map ANC use, and identify inequalities in service access and provision. Thus, this study aimed to assess the spatial patterns of ANC use, and to identify associated factors among pregnant women in Ethiopia.
            
            
              Method
              A secondary data analysis of the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey linked with the 2014 Ethiopian Service Provision Assessment was conducted. A multilevel analysis was carried out using the SAS GLIMMIX procedure. Furthermore, hot spot analysis and spatial regressions were carried out to identify the hot spot areas of and factors associated with the spatial variations in ANC use using ArcGIS and R softwares.
            
            
              Results
              A one-unit increase in the mean score of ANC service availability in a typical region was associated with a five-fold increase in the odds of having more ANC visits. Moreover, every one-kilometre increase in distance to the nearest ANC facility in a typical region was negatively associated with having at least four ANC visits. Twenty-five percent of the variability in having at least four ANC visits was accounted for by region of living. The spatial analysis found that the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples region had high clusters of at least four ANC visits. Furthermore, the coefficients of having the first ANC visit during the first trimester were estimated to have spatial variations in the use of at least four ANC visits.
            
            
              Conclusion
              There were significant variations in the use of ANC services across the different regions of Ethiopia. Region of living and distance were key drivers of ANC use underscoring the need for increased ANC availability, particularly in the cold spot regions.},

In these countries, malaria control activities are implemented at the health-district level (operational entity of the national health system), while malaria readiness indicators are regionally representative. This study provides an approach for estimating health district-level malaria readiness indicators from survey data designed to provide regionally representative estimates. A binomial-hierarchical Bayesian spatial prediction method was applied to Burkina Faso Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) survey data to provide estimates of essential equipment availability and readiness for malaria care. Predicted values of each indicator were adjusted by the type of health facility, location, and population density. Then, a health district composite readiness profile was built via hierarchical ascendant classification. All surveyed health-facilities were mandated by the Ministry of Health to manage malaria cases. The spatial distribution of essential equipment and malaria readiness was heterogeneous. Around 62.9\% of health districts had a high level of readiness to provide malaria care and prevention during pregnancy. Low-performance scores for managing malaria cases were found in big cities. Health districts with low coverage for both first-line antimalarial drugs and rapid diagnostic tests were Baskuy, Bogodogo, Boulmiougou, Nongr-Massoum, Sig-Nonghin, Dafra, and Do. We provide health district estimates and reveal gaps in basic equipment and malaria management resources in some districts that need to be filled. By providing local-scale estimates, this approach could be replicated for other types of indicators to inform decision makers and health program managers and to identify priority areas.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              Poor access to quality healthcare is one of the most important reasons of high maternal and neonatal mortality in India, particularly in poorer states like Bihar. India has implemented initiatives to promote institutional maternal deliveries. It is important to ensure that health facilities are adequately equipped and staffed to provide quality care for mothers and newborns.
            
            
              Methods
              We conducted a cross-sectional study of 190 primary health centres (PHCs) and 36 district hospitals (DHs) across all districts in Bihar to assess the readiness of facilities to provide quality maternal and neonatal care. Infrastructure, equipment and supplies and staffing were assessed using the WHO service availability and readiness assessment and Indian public health standard guidelines. Additionally, we used household survey data to assess the quality of care reported by mothers delivering at study facilities.
            
            
              Results
              PHCs and DHs were found to have 61\% and 67\% of the mandated structural components to provide maternal and neonatal care, on average, respectively. DHs were, on average, slightly better equipped in terms of infrastructure, equipment and supplies by comparison to PHCs. DHs were found to be inadequately prepared to provide neonatal care. Lack of recommended handwashing stations and bins at both DHs and PHCs suggested low levels of hygiene. Only half of the essential drugs were available in both DHs and PHCs. While no association was revealed between structural capacity and patient-reported quality of care, adequacy of staffing was positively associated with the quality of care in DHs.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Examining all DHs and a representative sample of PHCs in Bihar, this study revealed the gaps in structural components that need to be filled to provide quality care to mothers and newborns. Access to quality care is essential if progress in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality is to be achieved in this high-burden state.},

              Background
              Early initiation of breastfeeding (within an hour of birth) has benefits for newborn health and survival. Optimal breastfeeding supports growth, health, and development. Health facilities provide essential pregnancy, maternal, and newborn care and offer support for early breastfeeding. We examined the relationship between the breastfeeding-related health service environment during antenatal care (ANC) and early initiation of breastfeeding.
            
            
              Methods
              Using data from recent Service Provision Assessment (SPA) surveys in Haiti and Malawi, we defined three indicators of the health service environment: availability of facilities with ANC services reporting routine breastfeeding counseling; provider training on breastfeeding; and breastfeeding counseling during ANC. We linked SPA data geographically to Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data from Haiti and Malawi. Multilevel, multivariable logistic regressions examined associations between the health service environment and early initiation of breastfeeding, controlling for women’s background characteristics, with separate analyses for urban and rural residence.
            
            
              Results
              Over 95\% of facilities in Haiti and Malawi reported routinely providing breastfeeding counseling during ANC. Only 40\% of both urban and rural providers in Malawi and 29 and 26\% of providers at urban and rural facilities in Haiti (respectively) received recent training in counseling on breastfeeding. Further, only 4–10\% of clients received counseling. Breastfeeding counseling was generally more common among clients who attended ANC with a provider who had received recent training. After linking SPA and DHS data, our analysis showed that having more providers recently trained on breastfeeding was significantly associated with increased odds of early breastfeeding among women in urban areas of Haiti and Malawi. Additionally, women in urban areas of Malawi lived near facilities with more counseling during ANC were more likely to begin breastfeeding within an hour of birth compared with women in areas with less counseling.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our study identified gaps in the health system’s capacity to implement the recommended global guidelines in support of optimal breastfeeding practices. While breastfeeding counseling during ANC can promote early breastfeeding, counseling was not common. The study provides evidence that provider training could help improve counseling and support for early initiation of breastfeeding.},

              Background
              Nigeria faces an increase in the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), leading to an estimated 29\% of all deaths in the country. Nigeria has an estimated hypertension prevalence ranging from 25 to 40\% of her adult population. Despite this high burden, awareness (14–30\%), treatment ({\textless} 20\%), and control (9\%) rates of hypertension are low in Nigeria. Against this backdrop, we sought to perform capacity and readiness assessments of public Primary Healthcare Centers (PHCs) to inform Nigeria’s system-level hypertension control program’s implementation and adaptation strategies.
            
            
              Methods
              The study employed a multi-stage sampling to select 60 from the 243 PHCs in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) of Nigeria. The World Health Organization (WHO) Service Availability and Readiness Assessment was adapted to focus on hypertension diagnosis and treatment and was administered to PHC staff from May 2019 – October 2019. Indicator scores for general and cardiovascular service readiness were calculated based on the proportion of sites with available amenities, equipment, diagnostic tests, and medications.
            
            
              Results
              
                Median (interquartile range [IQR]) number of full-time staff was 5 (3–8), and were predominantly community health extension workers (median = 3 [IQR 2–5]). Few sites (
                n
                 = 8; 15\%) received cardiovascular disease diagnosis and management training within the previous 2 years, though most had sufficient capacity for screening (
                n
                 = 58; 97\%), diagnosis (
                n
                 = 56; 93\%), and confirmation (
                n
                 = 50; 83\%) of hypertension. Few PHCs had guidelines (
                n
                 = 7; 13\%), treatment algorithms (
                n
                 = 3; 5\%), or information materials (
                n
                 = 1; 2\%) for hypertension. Most sites (
                n
                 = 55; 92\%) had one or more functional blood pressure apparatus. All sites relied on paper records, and few had a functional computer (
                n
                 = 10; 17\%) or access to internet (
                n
                 = 5; 8\%). Despite inclusion on Nigeria’s essential medicines list, 35 (59\%) PHCs had zero 30-day treatment regimens of any blood pressure-lowering medications in stock.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              This first systematic assessment of capacity and readiness for a system-level hypertension control program within the FCT of Nigeria demonstrated implementation feasibility based on the workforce, equipment, and paper-based information systems, but a critical need for essential medicine supply strengthening, health-worker training, and protocols for hypertension treatment and control in Nigeria.},

              Background
              This study explored the role of health facility availability as it relates to maternal and newborn PNC use in rural Malawi.
            
            
              Methods
              Malawi Demographic and Health Survey (MDHS) 2015–16 data, MDHS 2015–16 household cluster GPS data, Malawi Service Provision Assessment (MSPA) 2013–14 data and MSPA 2013–14 facility GPS data were used. Household clusters were spatially linked with facilities using buffers. Descriptive analyses were performed and generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to determine the effects of having different types of facilities at varying distances from household clusters on receipt of maternal and newborn PNC in rural Malawi.
            
            
              Results
              In rural Malawi, around 96\% of women had facilities providing PNC within 10 km of where they live. Among women who have clinic-level facilities within 5 km of where they live, around 25\% had clinic-level facilities that provide PNC. For rural women who gave birth in the past 5 years preceding the survey, only about 3\% received maternal PNC within 24 h and about 16\% received maternal PNC within the first week. As for newborn PNC, 3\% of newborns had PNC within 24 h and about 26\% had newborn PNC within the first week. PNC mostly took place at facilities (94\% for women and 95\% for newborns). For women who delivered at home, having a health center providing PNC within 5 km was positively associated with maternal and newborn PNC. For women who delivered at facilities, having a health center providing PNC within 5 km was positively associated with maternal PNC and having a health center providing PNC between 5 km and 10 km was positively associated with both maternal and newborn PNC. Regardless of the place of delivery and distance band, having a clinic-level facility providing PNC did not have significant positive effects on maternal and newborn PNC.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Providers should be trained to perform quality PNC at all facilities. It would also be important to address concerns related to health workers. Lastly, it would be key to increase community awareness about the importance of seeking timely PNC and about the utility of lower-level facilities for receiving preventative PNC.},

              Design
              Cross-sectional analysis of population-based and health facility data.
            
            
              Setting
              Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey data linked to Service Provision Assessment data.
            
            
              Population
              8473 married women and 1020 facilities that reported providing family planning services.
            
            
              Methods
              A linked secondary data analysis of population and health facility data was carried out. Both multilevel and spatial analyses were conducted to identify key determinants of women’s use of modern contraceptive and spatial clustering of modern contraceptive use.
            
            
              Main outcome measure
              Modern contraceptive use.
            
            
              Results
              About 24\% of the variation in the use of modern contraception was accounted for by location. A one-unit increase in the mean score of health facilities’ readiness to provide short-term modern contraceptives in a typical region was associated with a 20-fold increase in the odds of modern contraceptive use (adjusted OR (AOR) 20.49, 95\% CI 1.44 to 29.54). In the spatial analysis, it was found that Addis Ababa and the Amhara region had high clusters of modern contraceptive use rates. On the other hand, low rates of contraceptive use were clustered in the Afar and Somali regions.
            
            
              Conclusion
              There were significant variations in the use of modern contraceptives across the different regions of Ethiopia. Therefore, regions with low contraceptive rates and high fertility rates should be targeted for scaling up and tailoring of services to the culture and lifestyles of the population of those regions.},

              Background
              Both availability and quality of family planning services are believed to have contributed to increasing contraceptive use and declining fertility rates in developing countries. Yet, there is limited empirical evidence to show the relationship between the quality of family planning services and the population based prevalence of contraceptive methods. This study examined the relationship between quality of family planning services and use of intrauterine devices (IUD) in Egypt.
            
            
              Methods
              
                The analysis used data from the 2003 Egypt Interim Demographic and Health Survey (EIDHS) that included 8,445 married women aged 15–49, and the 2002 Egypt Service Provision Assessment (ESPA) survey that included 602 facilities offering family planning services. The EIDHS collected latitude and longitude coordinates of all sampled clusters, and the ESPA collected these coordinates for all sampled facilities. Using Geographic Information System (GIS) methods, individual women were linked to a facility located within 10 km of their community. A facility-level index was constructed to reflect the quality of family planning services. Four dimensions of quality of care were examined: counseling, examination room, supply of contraceptive methods, and management. Effects of quality of family planning services on the use of IUD and other contraceptive methods were estimated using multinomial logistic regression. Results are presented as relative risk ratios (RRR) with significance levels (
                p
                -values).
              
            
            
              Results
              
                IUD use among women who obtained their method from public sources was significantly positively associated with quality of family planning services (RRR = 1.36,
                p
                {\textless} 0.01), independent of distance to the facility, facility type, age, number of living children, education level, household wealth status, and residence. Quality of services related to counseling and examination room had strong positive effects on use of IUD (RRR = 1.61 for counseling and RRR = 1.46 for examination room). Obtaining IUD from a private source or using other contraceptive methods was not associated with quality of services.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              This study is one among the few that used geographic information to link data from a population-based survey with an independently sampled health facility survey. The findings demonstrate that service quality is an important determinant of use of clinical contraceptive methods in Egypt. Improving quality of family planning services may help further increase use of clinical contraceptive methods and reduce fertility.},

              Objective
              The objective of this study was to evaluate the tuberculosis (TB) health system capacity and its variations by location and types of health facilities in Ethiopia.
            
            
              Design
              We used the Service Provision Assessment plus (SPA+) survey data that were collected in 2014 in all hospitals and randomly selected health centers and private facilities in all regions of Ethiopia. We assessed structural, process and overall health system capacity based on the Donabedian quality of care model. Multiple linear regression and spatial analysis were done to assess TB capacity score variation across regions.
            
            
              Setting
              The study included 873 public and private health facilities all over Ethiopia.
            
            
              Participants
              None.

              Results
              A total of 873 health facilities were included in the analysis. The overall TB care capacity score was 76.7\%, 55.9\% and 37.8\% in public hospitals, health centers and private facilities, respectively. The health system capacity score for TB was higher in the urban (60.4\%) facilities compared to that of the rural (50.0\%) facilities (β = 8.0, 95\% CI: 4.4, 11.6). Health centers (β = −16.2, 95\% CI: −20.0, −12.3) and private health facilities (β = −38.3, 95\% CI: −42.4, −35.1) had lower TB care capacity score than hospitals. Overall TB care capacity score were lower in Western and Southwestern Ethiopia and in Benishangul-Gumuz and Gambella regions.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The health system capacity score for TB care in Ethiopia varied across regions. Health system capacity improvement interventions should focus on the private sectors and health facilities in the rural and remote areas to ensure equity and improve quality of care.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              Increases in facility deliveries in sub-Saharan Africa have not yielded expected declines in maternal mortality, raising concerns about the quality of care provided in facilities. The readiness of facilities at different health system levels to provide both emergency obstetric and newborn care (EmONC) as well as referral is unknown. We describe this combined readiness by facility level and region in Senegal.
            
            
              Methods
              For this cross-sectional study, we used data from nine Demographic and Health Surveys between 1992 and 2017 in Senegal to describe trends in location of births over time. We used data from the 2017 Service Provision Assessment to describe EmONC and emergency referral readiness across facility levels in the public system, where 94\% of facility births occur. A national global positioning system facility census was used to map access from lower-level facilities to the nearest facility performing caesareans.
            
            
              Results
              Births in facilities increased from 47\% in 1992 to 80\% in 2016, driven by births in lower-level health posts, where half of facility births now occur. Caesarean rates in rural areas more than doubled but only to 3.7\%, indicating minor improvements in EmONC access. Only 9\% of health posts had full readiness for basic EmONC, and 62\% had adequate referral readiness (vehicle on-site or telephone and vehicle access elsewhere). Although public facilities accounted for three-quarters of all births in 2016, only 16\% of such births occurred in facilities able to provide adequate combined readiness for EmONC and referral.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our findings imply that many lower-level public facilities—the most common place of birth in Senegal—are unable to treat or refer women with obstetric complications, especially in rural areas. In light of rising lower-level facility births in Senegal and elsewhere, improvements in EmONC and referral readiness are urgently needed to accelerate reductions in maternal and perinatal mortality.},

Goal number five aimed to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters and provide universal access to reproductive healthcare services by 2015. While there has been some progress, MDG 5 fell far short of target goals, highlighting the necessity of further improvement in global maternal health. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), this study aims to understand how distance to facility and quality of care, which are components of access, affect maternal service utilization in two of the world’s poorest countries, Haiti and Kenya. Furthermore, this study examines how this relationship may change or hold between urban and rural regions. Data from the United States Agency for International Development Demographic and Health Survey and Service Provision Assessment were linked spatially in a GIS model, drawing comparisons among distance to facility, quality of care, and maternal health service utilization. Results show that in both rural and urban regions, access to maternal health service and maternal health service utilization share a similar spatial pattern. In urban regions, pockets of maternal health disparities exist despite close distance to facility and standard quality of care. In rural regions, there are areas with long distances to facilities and low quality of care, resulting in poor maternal service usage. This study highlights the usefulness of GIS as a tool to evaluate disparities in maternal healthcare provision and usage.},

	abstract = {Objective
              Increasing the availability of basic healthcare services in low-and middle-income countries is not sufficient to meet the Sustainable Development Goal target for child survival in high-mortality settings, where healthcare utilisation is often inconsistent and quality of care can be poor. We assessed whether poor quality of sick child healthcare in Malawi is associated with low utilisation of sick child healthcare.
            
            
              Design
              We measured two elements of quality of sick child healthcare: facility structural readiness and process of care using data from the 2013 Malawi Service Provision Assessment. Overall quality was defined as the average of these metrics. We extracted demographic data from the 2013–2014 Malawi Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey and linked households to nearby facilities using geocodes. We used logistic regression to examine the association of facility quality with utilisation of formal health services for children under 5 years of age suffering diarrhoea, fever or cough/acute respiratory illness, controlling for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. We conducted sensitivity analyses (SAs), modifying the travel distance and population—facility matching criteria.
            
            
              Setting and population
              568 facilities were linked with 9701 children with recent illness symptoms in Malawi, of whom 69\% had been brought to a health facility.
            
            
              Results
              Overall, facilities showed gaps in structural quality (62\% readiness) and major deficiencies in process quality (33\%), for an overall quality score of 48\%. Better facility quality was associated with higher odds of utilisation of sick child healthcare services (adjusted ORs (AOR): 1.66, 95\% CI: 1.04 to 2.63), as was structural quality alone (AOR: 1.33, 95\% CI: 0.95 to 1.87). SAs supported the main finding.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Although Malawi’s health facilities for curative child care are widely available, quality and utilisation of sick child healthcare services are in short supply. Improving facility quality may provide a way to encourage higher utilisation of healthcare, thereby decreasing preventable childhood morbidity and mortality.},

              Background
              When Service Provision Assessment (SPA) surveys on primary health service delivery are combined with the nationally representative household survey—Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), they can provide key information on the access, utilization, and equity of health service availability in low- and middle-income countries. However, existing linkage methods have been established only at aggregate levels due to known limitations of the survey datasets.
            
            
              Methods
              For the linkage of two data sets at a disaggregated level, we developed a geostatistical approach where SPA limitations are explicitly accounted for by identifying the sites where health facilities might be present but not included in SPA surveys. Using the knowledge gained from SPA surveys related to the contextual information around facilities and their spatial structure, we made an inference on the service environment of unsampled health facilities. The geostatistical linkage results on the availability of health service were validated using two criteria—prediction accuracy and classification error. We also assessed the effect of displacement of DHS clusters on the linkage results using simulation.
            
            
              Results
              The performance evaluation of the geostatistical linkage method, demonstrated using information on the general service readiness of sampled health facilities in Tanzania, showed that the proposed methods exceeded the performance of the existing methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and classification error. We also found that the geostatistical linkage methods are more robust than existing methods with respect to the displacement of DHS clusters.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The proposed geospatial approach minimizes the methodological issues and has potential to be used in various public health research applications where facility and population-based data need to be combined at fine spatial scale.},

The purpose of this study is to contribute with evidence for decision-making on the reform of the country’s healthcare map, by analyzing the availability and readiness of services at the facilities that may become part of a Hospital Complex in Bissau, proposed in the National Health Development Plan.Material and Methods: We analyzed 13 public and private facilities with inpatient capacity, located in Bissau and Biombo. Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) tools were used for data collection, treatment and analysis.Results: A comprehensive overview of these facilities has been provided, describing their general capacity to provide care and their readiness to implement it, along with the availability and readiness of specific services: diagnosis, family planning, mother and child health, obstetrics, communicable and non communicable diseases, blood transfusion and surgery. We observed a greater concentration of beds and professionals in the facilities of public sector, the only that provides all the specific services analyzed. Private sector services with agreements to supply the public sector have higher readiness levels and the private sector has the lowest operating capacity.Discussion: Findings reflect the lack of equipment, infrastructure and resources, the predominance of the public sector and the growth of the private for-profit and non-profit sectors, as well as inadequacies in planning and regulation. Similarities and differences between our findings and those described in the literature for other African countries are identified.Conclusion: This study reinforces the relevance of developing integrated and rational responses of health services and provides evidence for this.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              This study linked data from the 2012 Haiti Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and the 2013 Haiti Service Provision Assessment (SPA) to estimate the extent to which women’s contraceptive use is associated with the method choices available in Haiti’s health facilities.
            
            
              Methods
              Using Global Positioning System (GPS) data for DHS clusters and for health facilities, we linked each DHS cluster to all of the family planning facilities located within a specified distance, and then measured the cluster’s level of contraceptive method choice based on the number of facilities within the buffer zone that offered three or more modern contraceptive methods. Random intercept logistic regressions were used to model the variation in individual modern contraceptive use and the availability of multiple method choices at the cluster level.
            
            
              Results
              Limited number of family planning facilities in Haiti offered at least three modern contraceptive methods (51\% in urban and 23\% in rural). Seventeen percent of both rural and urban women lived in an area with low availability of multiple methods—meaning that no facility in the specified buffer zone offered three or more contraceptive methods. Another 29\% of rural women and 41\% of urban women had medium availability—that is, only one facility in the buffer zone offered three or more methods. In rural areas, compared with women living in a cluster with low availability of multiple methods, the odds of using a modern method are 73\% higher for women living in a cluster with medium availability, and over twice as high for women living in a cluster with high availability. A similar positive relationship was also found in urban areas.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Women in Haiti have only limited proximity to a health facility offering a variety of contraceptive methods. Improving access to a range of methods available at health facilities near where people live is critical for increasing contraceptive use in both urban and rural areas of Haiti.},

              Background
              The Service Availability and Readiness Assessment surveys generate data on the readiness of health facility services. We constructed a readiness index related to malaria services and determined the association between health facility malaria readiness and malaria mortality in children under the age of 5 years in Burkina Faso.
            
            
              Methods
              Data on inpatients visits and malaria-related deaths in under 5-year-old children were extracted from the national Health Management Information System in Burkina Faso. Bayesian geostatistical models with variable selection were fitted to malaria mortality data. The most important facility readiness indicators related to general and malaria-specific services were determined. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was employed to construct a composite facility readiness score based on multiple factorial axes. The analysis was carried out separately for 112 medical centres and 546 peripheral health centres.
            
            
              Results
              
                Malaria mortality rate in medical centres was 4.8 times higher than that of peripheral health centres (3.5\% vs. 0.7\%,
                p
                 {\textless} 0.0001). Essential medicines was the domain with the lowest readiness (only 0.1\% of medical centres and 0\% of peripheral health centres had the whole set of tracer items of essential medicines). Basic equipment readiness was the highest. The composite readiness score explained 30 and 53\% of the original set of items for medical centres and peripheral health centres, respectively. Mortality rate ratio (MRR) was by 59\% (MRR = 0.41, 95\% Bayesian credible interval: 0.19–0.91) lower in the high readiness group of peripheral health centres, compared to the low readiness group. Medical centres readiness was not related to malaria mortality. The geographical distribution of malaria mortality rate indicate that regions with health facilities with high readiness show lower mortality rates.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Performant health services in Burkina Faso are associated with lower malaria mortality rates. Health system readiness should be strengthened in the regions of Sahel, Sud-Ouest and Boucle du Mouhoun. Emphasis should be placed on improving the management of essential medicines and to reducing delays of emergency transportation between the different levels of the health system.},

	abstract = {Objectives
To describe the processes used to update the PRISMA 2009 statement for reporting systematic reviews, present results of a survey conducted to inform the update, summarize decisions made at the PRISMA update meeting, and describe and justify changes made to the guideline.
Methods
We reviewed 60 documents with reporting guidance for systematic reviews to generate suggested modifications to the PRISMA 2009 statement. We invited 220 systematic review methodologists and journal editors to complete a survey about the suggested modifications. The results of these projects were discussed at a 21-member in-person meeting. Following the meeting, we drafted the PRISMA 2020 statement and refined it based on feedback from co-authors and a convenience sample of 15 systematic reviewers.
Results
The review of 60 documents revealed that all topics addressed by the PRISMA 2009 statement could be modified. Of the 110 survey respondents, more than 66\% recommended keeping six of the original checklist items as they were and modifying 15 of them using wording suggested by us. Attendees at the in-person meeting supported the revised wording for several items but suggested rewording for most to enhance clarity, and further refinements were made over six drafts of the guideline.
Conclusions
The PRISMA 2020 statement consists of updated reporting guidance for systematic reviews. We hope that providing this detailed description of the development process will enhance the acceptance and uptake of the guideline and assist those developing and updating future reporting guidelines.},

	abstract = {Primary health care offers a cost–effective route to achieving universal health coverage (UHC). However, primary health-care systems are weak in many low- and middle-income countries and often fail to provide comprehensive, people-centred, integrated care. We analysed the primary health-care systems in 20 low- and middle-income countries using a semi-grounded approach. Options for strengthening primary health-care systems were identified by thematic content analysis. We found that: (i) despite the growing burden of noncommunicable disease, many low- and middle-income countries lacked funds for preventive services; (ii) community health workers were often under-resourced, poorly supported and lacked training; (iii) out-of-pocket expenditure exceeded 40\% of total health expenditure in half the countries studied, which affected equity; and (iv) health insurance schemes were hampered by the fragmentation of public and private systems, underfunding, corruption and poor engagement of informal workers. In 14 countries, the private sector was largely unregulated. Moreover, community engagement in primary health care was weak in countries where services were largely privatized. In some countries, decentralization led to the fragmentation of primary health care. Performance improved when financial incentives were linked to regulation and quality improvement, and community involvement was strong. Policy-making should be supported by adequate resources for primary health-care implementation and government spending on primary health care should be increased by at least 1\% of gross domestic product. Devising equity-enhancing financing schemes and improving the accountability of primary health-care management is also needed. Support from primary health-care systems is critical for progress towards UHC in the decade to 2030.},

	abstract = {Background
Reductions in neonatal mortality remain stagnant, despite gains in health care access and utilization. Nutrition interventions during antenatal care (ANC) and in the immediate postpartum period are associated with improved neonatal outcomes. Adjusting coverage estimates for the quality of care provided yields greater insight into health system performance and potential population health benefits of accessing care. In this cross-sectional study, we adjust maternity care coverage measures for quality of nutrition interventions to determine the impact on infant birth weight and breastfeeding.

Methods
We used household data from the Malawi 2013-2014 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey to assess use of maternal health services and direct observations of ANC and delivery from the 2013 Service Provision Assessment to measure nutrition interventions provided. We adjusted coverage measures combining self-reported utilization of care with the likelihood of receipt of nutrition interventions. Using adjusted log-linear regression, we estimated the associations of these nutrition quality-adjusted metrics with infant birthweight and immediate breastfeeding.

Results
Health facility data provided over 2500 directly observed clinical encounters and household data provided 7385 individual reports of health care utilization and outcomes. Utilization of ANC and facility-delivery was high. Women received nutrition-related interventions considerably less often than they sought care: over the course of ANC women received a median of 1.6 interventions on iron, 1 instance of nutrition counseling, and 0.06 instances of breastfeeding counseling. Nutrition quality-adjusted ANC coverage was associated with a reduced risk of low birthweight (adjusted relative risk [ARR] 0.87, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.79, 0.96) and increased likelihood of immediate breastfeeding (ARR = 1.04, 95\% CI = 1.02, 1.07); nutrition quality-adjusted post-delivery care was also associated with greater uptake of immediate breastfeeding (ARR = 1.08, 95\% CI = 1.02, 1.14). Based on these models, delivering nutrition interventions consistently within the existing level of coverage would decrease population prevalence of low birthweight from 13.7\% to 10.8\% and increase population prevalence of immediate breastfeeding from 75.9\% to 86.0\%.

Conclusions
Linking household survey data to health service provision assessments demonstrates that despite high utilization of maternal health services in Malawi, low provision of nutrition interventions is undermining infant health. Substantial gains in newborn health are possible in Malawi if quality of existing services is strengthened.},

	abstract = {Injury is a leading cause of the global disease burden, accounting for 10 percent of all deaths worldwide. Despite 90 percent of these deaths occurring in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), the majority of trauma research and infrastructure development has taken place in high-income settings. Furthermore, although accessible services are of central importance to a mature trauma system, there remains a paucity of literature describing the spatial accessibility of emergency services in LMICs. Using data from the Service Provision Assessment component of the Demographic and Health Surveys of Namibia and Haiti we defined the capabilities of healthcare facilities in each country in terms of their preparedness to provide emergency services. A Geographic Information System-based network analysis method was used to define 5- 10- and 50-kilometer catchment areas for all facilities capable of providing 24-hour care, higher-level resuscitative services or tertiary care. The proportion of a country’s population with access to each level of service was obtained by amalgamating the catchment areas with a population layer. A significant proportion of the population of both countries had poor spatial access to lower level services with 25\% of the population of Haiti and 51\% of the population of Namibia living further than 50 kilometers from a facility capable of providing 24-hour care. Spatial access to tertiary care was considerably lower with 51\% of Haitians and 72\% of Namibians having no access to these higher-level services within 50 kilometers. These results demonstrate a significant disparity in potential spatial access to emergency services in two LMICs compared to analogous estimates from high-income settings, and suggest that strengthening the capabilities of existing facilities may improve the equity of emergency services in these countries. Routine collection of georeferenced patient and facility data in LMICs will be important to understanding how spatial access to services influences outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background Geospatial data are important in monitoring many aspects of healthcare development. Geographically linking health facility data with population data is an important area of public health research. Examining healthcare problems spatially and hierarchically assists with efficient resource allocation and the monitoring and evaluation of service efficacy at different levels. This paper explored methodological issues associated with geographic data linkage, and the spatial and multilevel analyses that could be considered in analysing maternal health service data. Methods The 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey and the 2014 Ethiopia Service Provision Assessment data were used. Two geographic data linking methods were used to link these two datasets. Administrative boundary link was used to link a sample of health facilities data with population survey data for analysing three areas of maternal health service use. Euclidean buffer link was used for a census of hospitals to analyse caesarean delivery use in Ethiopia. The Global Moran’s I and the Getis-Ord Gi* statistics need to be carried out for identifying hot spots of maternal health service use in ArcGIS software. In addition to this, since the two datasets contain hierarchical data, a multilevel analysis was carried out to identify key determinants of maternal health service use in Ethiopia. Results Administrative boundary link gave more types of health facilities and more maternal health services as compared to the Euclidean buffer link. Administrative boundary link is the method of choice in case of sampled health facilities. However, for a census of health facilities, the Euclidean buffer link is the appropriate choice as this provides cluster level service environment estimates, which the administrative boundary link does not. Applying a False Discovery Rate correction enables the identification of true spatial clusters of maternal health service use. Conclusions A service environment link minimizes the methodological issues associated with geographic data linkage. A False Discovery Rate correction needs to be used to account for multiple and dependent testing while carrying out local spatial statistics. Examining maternal health service use both spatially and hierarchically has tremendous importance for identifying geographic areas that need special emphasis and for intervention purposes.},

	abstract = {Introduction This study linked data from the 2012 Haiti Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and the 2013 Haiti Service Provision Assessment (SPA) to estimate the extent to which women’s contraceptive use is associated with the method choices available in Haiti’s health facilities.
Methods Using Global Positioning System (GPS) data for DHS clusters and for health facilities, we linked each DHS cluster to all of the family planning facilities located within a specified distance, and then measured the cluster’s level of contraceptive method choice based on the number of facilities within the buffer zone that offered three or more modern contraceptive methods. Random intercept logistic regressions were used to model the variation in individual modern contraceptive use and the availability of multiple method choices at the cluster level.
Results Limited number of family planning facilities in Haiti offered at least three modern contraceptive methods (51\% in urban and 23\% in rural). Seventeen percent of both rural and urban women lived in an area with low availability of multiple methods—meaning that no facility in the specified buffer zone offered three or more contraceptive methods. Another 29\% of rural women and 41\% of urban women had medium availability—that is, only one facility in the buffer zone offered three or more methods. In rural areas, compared with women living in a cluster with low availability of multiple methods, the odds of using a modern method are 73\% higher for women living in a cluster with medium availability, and over twice as high for women living in a cluster with high availability. A similar positive relationship was also found in urban areas.
Conclusions Women in Haiti have only limited proximity to a health facility offering a variety of contraceptive methods. Improving access to a range of methods available at health facilities near where people live is critical for increasing contraceptive use in both urban and rural areas of Haiti.},

	abstract = {Introduction The growing use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to link population-level data to health facility data is key for the inclusion of health system environments in analyses of health disparities. However, such approaches commonly focus on just a couple of aspects of the health system environment and only report on the average and independent effect of each dimension.
Methods Using GIS to link Demographic and Health Survey data on births (2008–13/14) to Service Availability and Readiness Assessment data on health facilities (2010) in Zambia, this paper rigorously measures the multiple dimensions of an accessible health system environment. Using multilevel Bayesian methods (multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy), it investigates whether multidimensional health system environments defined with reference to both geographic and social location cut across individual-level and community-level heterogeneity to reliably predict facility delivery.
Results Random intercepts representing different health system environments have an intraclass correlation coefficient of 25\%, which demonstrates high levels of discriminatory accuracy. Health system environments with four or more access barriers are particularly likely to predict lower than average access to facility delivery. Including barriers related to geographic location in the non-random part of the model results in a proportional change in variance of 74\% relative to only 27\% for barriers related to social discrimination.
Conclusions Health system environments defined as a combination of geographic and social location can effectively distinguish between population groups with high versus low probabilities of access. Barriers related to geographic location appear more important than social discrimination in the context of Zambian maternal healthcare access. Under a progressive universalism approach, resources should be disproportionately invested in the worst health system environments.},

	abstract = {Introduction Increases in facility deliveries in sub-Saharan Africa have not yielded expected declines in maternal mortality, raising concerns about the quality of care provided in facilities. The readiness of facilities at different health system levels to provide both emergency obstetric and newborn care (EmONC) as well as referral is unknown. We describe this combined readiness by facility level and region in Senegal.
Methods For this cross-sectional study, we used data from nine Demographic and Health Surveys between 1992 and 2017 in Senegal to describe trends in location of births over time. We used data from the 2017 Service Provision Assessment to describe EmONC and emergency referral readiness across facility levels in the public system, where 94\% of facility births occur. A national global positioning system facility census was used to map access from lower-level facilities to the nearest facility performing caesareans.
Results Births in facilities increased from 47\% in 1992 to 80\% in 2016, driven by births in lower-level health posts, where half of facility births now occur. Caesarean rates in rural areas more than doubled but only to 3.7\%, indicating minor improvements in EmONC access. Only 9\% of health posts had full readiness for basic EmONC, and 62\% had adequate referral readiness (vehicle on-site or telephone and vehicle access elsewhere). Although public facilities accounted for three-quarters of all births in 2016, only 16\% of such births occurred in facilities able to provide adequate combined readiness for EmONC and referral.
Conclusions Our findings imply that many lower-level public facilities—the most common place of birth in Senegal—are unable to treat or refer women with obstetric complications, especially in rural areas. In light of rising lower-level facility births in Senegal and elsewhere, improvements in EmONC and referral readiness are urgently needed to accelerate reductions in maternal and perinatal mortality.},

A woman’s attendance for at least four antenatal care visits was significantly associated with facility birth (aOR 8.863, 95\% CI 6.748–11.640). Distance to a healthcare facility was inversely related to a woman’s use of facility birthing (aOR 0.967, 95\% CI 0.944–0.991). Women in the richest wealth quintile were also more likely to have facility births (aOR 2.892, 95\% CI 2.199–3.803). Conclusions There were geographic variations in facility births in Ethiopia, revealing critical gaps in service availability and readiness. It is important to ensure that health facilities are in a state of readiness to provide EmOC.

	abstract = {One of the major contributors of malaria-related deaths in Sub-Saharan African countries is the limited accessibility to quality care. In these countries, malaria control activities are implemented at the health-district level (operational entity of the national health system), while malaria readiness indicators are regionally representative. This study provides an approach for estimating health district-level malaria readiness indicators from survey data designed to provide regionally representative estimates. A binomial-hierarchical Bayesian spatial prediction method was applied to Burkina Faso Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) survey data to provide estimates of essential equipment availability and readiness for malaria care. Predicted values of each indicator were adjusted by the type of health facility, location, and population density. Then, a health district composite readiness profile was built via hierarchical ascendant classification. All surveyed health-facilities were mandated by the Ministry of Health to manage malaria cases. The spatial distribution of essential equipment and malaria readiness was heterogeneous. Around 62.9\% of health districts had a high level of readiness to provide malaria care and prevention during pregnancy. Low-performance scores for managing malaria cases were found in big cities. Health districts with low coverage for both first-line antimalarial drugs and rapid diagnostic tests were Baskuy, Bogodogo, Boulmiougou, Nongr-Massoum, Sig-Nonghin, Dafra, and Do. We provide health district estimates and reveal gaps in basic equipment and malaria management resources in some districts that need to be filled. By providing local-scale estimates, this approach could be replicated for other types of indicators to inform decision makers and health program managers and to identify priority areas.},

Methods Through a cross-sectional, observational study, we used a random intercept mixed effects multilevel logistic modelling approach to estimate the odds of having SBA and then applied model estimates to spatial layers to assess the probability of SBA at high-spatial resolution across Ghana. We combined data from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), routine birth registers, a service provision assessment of emergency obstetric care services, gridded population estimates and modelled travel time to health facilities. Results Within an hour's travel, 97.1\% of women sampled in the DHS could access any health facility, 96.6\% could reach a facility providing birthing services, and 86.2\% could reach a secondary hospital. After controlling for characteristics of individual women, living in an urban area and close proximity to a health facility with high-quality services were significant positive determinants of SBA uptake. The estimated variance suggests significant effects of cluster and region on SBA as 7.1\% of the residual variation in the propensity to use SBA is attributed to unobserved regional characteristics and 16.5\% between clusters within regions. Conclusion Given the expansion of primary care facilities in Ghana, this study suggests that higher quality healthcare services, as opposed to closer proximity of facilities to women, is needed to widen SBA uptake and improve maternal health.},

Design Cross-sectional analysis of population-based and health facility data.
Setting Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey data linked to Service Provision Assessment data.
Population 8473 married women and 1020 facilities that reported providing family planning services.
Methods A linked secondary data analysis of population and health facility data was carried out. Both multilevel and spatial analyses were conducted to identify key determinants of women’s use of modern contraceptive and spatial clustering of modern contraceptive use.
Main outcome measure Modern contraceptive use.
Results About 24\% of the variation in the use of modern contraception was accounted for by location. A one-unit increase in the mean score of health facilities’ readiness to provide short-term modern contraceptives in a typical region was associated with a 20-fold increase in the odds of modern contraceptive use (adjusted OR (AOR) 20.49, 95\% CI 1.44 to 29.54). In the spatial analysis, it was found that Addis Ababa and the Amhara region had high clusters of modern contraceptive use rates. On the other hand, low rates of contraceptive use were clustered in the Afar and Somali regions.
Conclusion There were significant variations in the use of modern contraceptives across the different regions of Ethiopia. Therefore, regions with low contraceptive rates and high fertility rates should be targeted for scaling up and tailoring of services to the culture and lifestyles of the population of those regions.},

	abstract = {Background
Health care utilization is affected by several factors including geographic accessibility. Empirical data on utilization of health facilities is important to understanding geographic accessibility and defining health facility catchments at a national level. Accurately defining catchment population improves the analysis of gaps in access, commodity needs and interpretation of disease incidence. Here, empirical household survey data on treatment seeking for fever were used to model the utilisation of public health facilities and define their catchment areas and populations in northern Namibia.

Method
This study uses data from the Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) of 2009 on treatment seeking for fever among children under the age of five years to characterize facility utilisation. Probability of attendance of public health facilities for fever treatment was modelled against a theoretical surface of travel times using a three parameter logistic model. The fitted model was then applied to a population surface to predict the number of children likely to use a public health facility during an episode of fever in northern Namibia.

Results
Overall, from the MIS survey, the prevalence of fever among children was 17.6\% CI [16.0-19.1] (401 of 2,283 children) while public health facility attendance for fever was 51.1\%, [95\%CI: 46.2-56.0]. The coefficients of the logistic model of travel time against fever treatment at public health facilities were all significant (p {\textless} 0.001). From this model, probability of facility attendance remained relatively high up to 180 minutes (3 hours) and thereafter decreased steadily. Total public health facility catchment population of children under the age five was estimated to be 162,286 in northern Namibia with an estimated fever burden of 24,830 children. Of the estimated fevers, 8,021 (32.3\%) were within 30 minutes of travel time to the nearest health facility while 14,902 (60.0\%) were within 1 hour.

Conclusion
This study demonstrates the potential of routine household surveys to empirically model health care utilisation for the treatment of childhood fever and define catchment populations enhancing the possibilities of accurate commodity needs assessment and calculation of disease incidence. These methods could be extended to other African countries where detailed mapping of health facilities exists.},

	abstract = {This research concentrates on the spatial accessibility assessment to healthcare facilities. Specifically, in doing so it compares the situation in urban and rural areas. In many countries, health inequalities continue to be a major public health challenge. Furthermore, there is also urbanization that occurs when people move from rural areas to urban areas. It leads to an increase in urban population and the extent of urban areas. Driven by population growth, many cities in low and middle-income countries are growing at record rates which puts large pressure on the healthcare system and facilities. Our research demonstrates that due to many political, economic, social and cultural factors, the current inequalities in health care between regions, urban and rural areas and different age and income groups are increasing. Thence, there is a pressing need for the improvement of the healthcare in the lagged regions and areas using such means as the advanced technologies, analysis of data, as well as targeted funding and assistance to those who need it the most.},

	abstract = {Background: HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis (TB) are major contributors to the burden of disease in sub-Saharan Africa. The two diseases have been described as a harmful synergy as they are biologically and epidemiologically linked. Control of TB/HIV co-infection is an integral and most challenging part of both national TB and national HIV control programmes, especially in contexts of instability where health systems are suffering from political and social strife. This study aimed at assessing the provision of HIV/TB co-infection services in health facilities in the conflict-ridden region of Goma in Democratic Republic of Congo. , 
Methods: A cross-sectional survey of health facilities that provide either HIV or TB services or both was carried out. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect the data which was analysed using descriptive statistics. , 
Results: Eighty facilities were identified, of which 64 facilities were publicly owned. TB care was more available than HIV care (in 61\% vs. 9\% of facilities). Twenty-three facilities (29\%) offered services to co-infected patients. TB/HIV co-infection rates among patients were unknown in 82\% of the facilities. Only 19 facilities (24\%) reported some coordination with and support from concerned diseases’ control programmes. HIV and TB services are largely fragmented, indicating imbalances and poor coordination by disease control programmes. , 
Conclusion: HIV and TB control appear not to be the focus of health interventions in this crisis affected region, despite the high risks of TB and HIV infection in the setting. Comprehensive public health response to this setting calls for reforms that promote joint TB/HIV co-infection control, including improved leadership by the HIV programmes that accuse weaknesses in this conflict-ridden region.},

To describe interviewer-related variability in abuse estimates and assess the nature of the interviewer effects on the associations between elder abuse and covariates.
Study Design and Setting
After intensive training, six interviewers administered structured questionnaires through face-to-face interviews to assess abuse in a population-based sample of 641 Portuguese individuals aged 60–84 years.
Results
The overall prevalence of abuse victimization during the previous year was 28.1\%, but it differed significantly according to the interviewer, ranging from 16.9\% to 36.8\%. There was no statistical effect modification introduced by the interviewer on the association of abuse and its determinants. Additionally, interviewer-level variables (empathy and violence beliefs) showed no significant contribution to explain the variance attributable to potential interviewer effects. Adjusting for the interviewer had little or no effect on the odds ratio of abuse for gender, age, education, and quality of life. However, the interviewer introduced relevant confounding of the associations between abuse and other sensitive topics, such as somatic complaints.
Conclusion
Although no relevant effect modification was observed, this study emphasizes the importance of the interviewer as a relevant confounder when estimating associations between sensitive variables, as it is the case of elder abuse.},

Traditional measures, such as a simple ratio of supply to demand in an area or distance to the closest provider, are easy measures for spatial accessibility. However the former one does not consider interactions between patients and providers across administrative borders and the latter does not account for the demand side, that is, the competition for the supply. With advancements in GIS, however, better measures of geographic accessibility, variants of a gravity model, have been applied. Among them are (1) a two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method and (2) a kernel density (KD) method. This microscopic study compared these two GIS-based measures of accessibility in our case study of dialysis service centers in Chicago. Our comparison study found a significant mismatch of the accessibility ratios between the two methods. Overall, the 2SFCA method produced better accessibility ratios. There is room for further improvement of the 2SFCA method—varying the radius of service area according to the type of provider or the type of neighborhood and determining the appropriate weight equation form—still warrant further study.},

The authors report results from qualitative interviews with 159 Vietnamese adolescents living in Hanoi, Nha Trang City, and Ninh Hoa District and a survey of 886 adolescents in these same three sites. In the qualitative interviews, youths report a strong adherence to ideals and values regarding abstinence outside of marriage. Youths reported low rates of engagement in vaginal, anal, and/or oral sex with a significant difference in reported behaviors between males (29/469, 6.2\%) and females (7/416, 1.7\%; p = .000). A total of 15 of 32 (46.9\%) sexually active youths reported rarely or never using condoms. Females had significantly higher scores for perceived sexual stigma than males (t = −10.22 [95\% confidence interval (CI); −3.72 to −2.52; p = .000) whereas males scored significantly lower than females on a scale of perceived self-efficacy for abstinence (t = 5.31 [95\% CI; .27 to .59]; p = .000). The stigmatization of sexual relations outside of marriage particularly for young women reinforces abstinence; however, these same values decrease adolescents’ ability to obtain accurate information about sexuality and HIV and sexually transmitted infections and engage in safer sex.},

Methods: A household sample of 142 sexually active African-American youths, 13–19 years old, was questioned about STD related stigma (alpha = 0.89), STD related shame (alpha = 0.90), and perceptions about disclosure of sexual behaviours to a doctor or nurse (alpha = 0.81).
Results: Among females, stigma was associated with increased anticipation of negative reactions to disclosure of sexual behaviours to a doctor or nurse (odds ratio (OR) = 0.319; 95\% confidence interval (CI) =0.12 to 0.85) while shame was not. Stigma was also independently associated with STD related care seeking in the past year (OR = 0.296; 95\% CI = 0.09 to 0.94) while shame was not. There was no association between stigma and shame with perceptions about disclosure or past care seeking in males. Perceived outcomes of disclosing sexual behaviours did not moderate the association of stigma, shame, and past STD related care seeking.
Conclusions: Stigma about STDs may influence how female adolescents perceive reactions to disclosure of their sexual behaviour to healthcare providers. It may also be an important factor in their decision seek to STD related care. Perceptions about disclosure of sexual behaviour to a doctor or nurse do not change the relation of stigma or shame to past STD related care seeking.},

	abstract = {Background
Sexual activity can expose adolescents to the risks of unintended pregnancy, unsafe abortion and sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS. This risk is magnified for girls. The objective of the study is to determine the magnitude and correlates of premarital sexual activity among unmarried female adolescents in northern Ethiopia.
Methods
The study employed a cross sectional study design conducted at comprehensive secondary school among unmarried female adolescents in Maichew town, northern Ethiopia. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression.
Results
A total of 624 secondary and preparatory school never married female adolescents were included in this study. About 183 (29.3\%) reported to have started sexual intercourse. Mean age at first sexual intercourse was 16.6 years (SD 1.81). About 38\% of the girls reported that they had used condom at their last sexual activity. In multivariable analysis, older age, living with parents, parental residence, elder sister or friends who had started premarital sexual activity, and peer influence, were independently associated with sexual initiation.
Conclusions
The study of this finding clearly demonstrated that rural adolescents initiate sexual activity early with limited protection from infections and unintended pregnancies. Community and school based sexual health education is recommended.},

This study aims to describe patterns of inconsistent reports of sexual intercourse among a sample of South African adolescents.
Methods
Consistency of reported lifetime sexual intercourse was assessed using five semiannual waves of data. Odds ratios related inconsistent reporting to demographic variables and potential indicators of general and risk-behavior–specific reliability problems.
Results
Of the sexually active participants in the sample, nearly 40\% reported being virgins after sexual activity had been reported at an earlier assessment. Inconsistent reporting could not be predicted by gender or race or by general indicators of poor reliability (inconsistent reporting of gender and birth year). However individuals with inconsistent reports of sexual intercourse were more likely to be inconsistent reporters of substance use.
Conclusions
These results suggest that researchers need to undertake efforts to deal specifically with inconsistent risk behavior data. These may include modification of data collection procedures and use of statistical methodologies that can account for response inconsistencies.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT
Social desirability bias is problematic in studies that rely on self-reported sexual behavior data. Where gender norms create different expectations about socially acceptable behavior, males and females face distinct pressures in reporting certain outcomes, which can distort assessments of risk for HIV and STIs.

METHODS
In 2009, relationship and sexual behavior data were collected from 1,750 never-married males and females aged 16–18 via audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (audio-CASI) during the third round of the Malawi Schooling and Adolescent Study. A comparison group of 311 youth completed an identical questionnaire in face-to-face interviews. To assess whether interview mode may have influenced participants’ reporting of sensitive behavior, reports of sexual experience in the two groups were compared. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify associations between interview mode and reports of these behaviors, by gender.

RESULTS
In adjusted regression models, males were less likely to report ever having had a girlfriend in audio-CASI than in face-to-face interviews (odds ratio, 0.4), but they were more likely to report having had sex with a relative or teacher (3.5). For females, reports of ever having had a boyfriend or having had sex did not differ between modes. A small proportion of females reported ever having had sex with a relative or teacher in audio-CASI, while none did so in face-to-face interviews.

CONCLUSIONS
The method used for collecting relationship and sexual behavior data may influence the reported prevalence of some key behaviors, particularly among males. Further research is needed to improve methods of collecting sensitive data.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Accurate and reliable data on the prevalence of adolescents' sexual behavior are paramount for effective sexual and reproductive health intervention. Adolescents' sexual behavior has been widely studied. However, scholars have raised concerns about the accuracy and reliability of self-reported sexual behavior by adolescents. Previous research shows high levels of adolescent sexual activity in urban informal settlements; yet, the accuracy of self-reported sexual experience in these settings is understudied.
Methods
The objective of this article is to assess consistency of self-reported sexual activity among 2324 adolescents living in slum and nonslum settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. We examine two forms of inconsistencies, namely, what we term “reborn virgins” and inconsistent timing of sexual debut, during two rounds of survey. Factors influencing inconsistent reporting are explored through logistic regression.
Results
A total of 469 (20\%) adolescents gave inconsistent information on whether they have ever had sex (n = 190) or timing of first intercourse (n = 279). Males, slum residents, and adolescents attending school were more likely to give inconsistent sexual information. Among inconsistent reporters, slum residents, adolescents reporting substance use, and those with secondary (vs. primary) education were more likely to reclaim virginity status than to misreport the timing of first sex. However, older adolescents were less likely to reclaim virginity status.
Conclusions
We found significant differences between adolescents who provide consistent reports and those who misreport sexual behavior data. We argue that researchers should account for biases stemming from misreporting of sensitive information among young people and, in particular, should be cognizant of how reporting quality may vary across demographic groups.},

Because key data and information platforms employ different measurement approaches—namely, different definitions of sexual recency—reports of contraceptive prevalence and unmet need among unmarried women are inconsistent. We examine how the measurement approaches employed by 3 large organizations yield such divergent estimates. We find that contraceptive prevalence and unmet need estimates among married women do not vary much by sexual recency. For unmarried women, contraceptive prevalence is systematically lower and unmet need is systematically higher as the sexual recency window widens. In the short term, we recommend using the 1-month cutoff as analyses reveal it yields the most precise estimates for better recognizing the needs of this important demographic group.},

              Background
              Obesity rates are recognized to be at epidemic levels throughout much of the world, posing significant threats to both the health and financial security of many nations. The causes of obesity can vary but are often complex and multifactorial, and while many contributing factors can be targeted for intervention, an understanding of where these interventions are needed is necessary in order to implement effective policy. This has prompted an interest in incorporating spatial context into the analysis and modeling of obesity determinants, especially through the use of geographically weighted regression (GWR).
            
            
              Method
              This paper provides a critical review of previous GWR models of obesogenic processes and then presents a novel application of multiscale (M)GWR using the Phoenix metropolitan area as a case study.
            
            
              Results
              
                Though the MGWR model consumes more degrees of freedom than OLS, it consumes far fewer degrees of freedom than GWR, ultimately resulting in a more nuanced analysis that can incorporate spatial context but does not force every relationship to become local
                a priori
                . In addition, MGWR yields a lower AIC and AICc value than GWR and is also less prone to issues of multicollinearity. Consequently, MGWR is able to improve our understanding of the factors that influence obesity rates by providing determinant-specific spatial contexts.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              The results show that a mix of global and local processes are able to best model obesity rates and that MGWR provides a richer yet more parsimonious quantitative representation of obesity rate determinants compared to both GWR and ordinary least squares.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background 
              Life expectancy at birth (LEB), one of the main indicators of human longevity, has often been used to characterise the health status of a population. Understanding its relationships with the deprivation is key to develop policies and evaluate interventions that are aimed at reducing health inequalities. However, methodological challenges in the analysis of LEB data arise from the fact that different Government agencies often provide spatially aggregated information on LEB and the index of multiple deprivation (IMD) at different spatial scales. Our objective is to develop a geostatistical framework that, unlike existing methods of inference, allows to carry out spatially continuous prediction while dealing with spatial misalignment of the areal-level data.
            
            
              Methods 
              We developed a model-based geostatistical approach for the joint analysis of LEB and IMD, when these are available over different partitions of the study region. We model the spatial correlation in LEB and IMD across the areal units using inter-point distances based on a regular grid covering the whole of the study area. The advantages and strengths of the new methodology are illustrated through an analysis of LEB and IMD data from the Liverpool district council.
            
            
              Results 
              We found that the effect of IMD on LEB is stronger in males than in females, explaining about 63.35\% of the spatial variation in LEB in the former group and 38.92\% in the latter. We also estimate that LEB is about 8.5 years lower between the most and least deprived area of Liverpool for men, and 7.1 years for women. Finally, we find that LEB, both in males and females, is at least 80\% likely to be above the England wide average only in some areas falling in the electoral wards of Childwall, Woolton and Church.
            
            
              Conclusion 
              The novel model-based geostatistical framework provides a feasible solution to the spatial misalignment problem. More importantly, the proposed methodology has the following advantages over existing methods used model LEB: (1) it can deliver spatially continuous inferences using spatially aggregated data; (2) it can be applied to any form of misalignment with information provided at a range of spatial scales, from areal-level to pixel-level.},

              Background
              Ecologic health studies often rely on outcomes from health service utilization data that are limited by relatively coarse spatial resolutions and missing geographic information, particularly neighborhood level identifiers. When fine-scale geographic data are missing, the ramifications and strategies for addressing them are not well researched or developed. This study illustrates a novel spatio-temporal framework that combines a geographic identifier assignment (i.e., geographic imputation) algorithm with predictive Bayesian variable selection to identify neighborhood factors associated with disparities in emergency department (ED) visits for asthma.
            
            
              Methods
              ED visit records with missing fine-scale spatial identifiers ({\textasciitilde} 20\%) were geocoded using information from known, coarser, misaligned spatial units using an innovative geographic identifier assignment algorithm. We then employed systematic variable selection in a spatio-temporal Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) predictive framework within the NIMBLE package in R. Our novel methodology is illustrated in an ecologic case study aimed at identifying neighborhood-level predictors of asthma ED visits in South Carolina, United States, from 1999 to 2015. The health outcome was annual ED visit counts in small areas (i.e., census tracts) with primary diagnoses of asthma (ICD9 codes 493.XX) among children ages 5 to 19 years.
            
            
              Results
              We maintained 96\% of ED visit records for this analysis. When the algorithm used areal proportions as probabilities for assignment, which addressed differential missingness of census tract identifiers in rural areas, variable selection consistently identified significant neighborhood-level predictors of asthma ED visit risk including pharmacy proximity, average household size, and carbon monoxide interactions. Contrasted with common solutions of removing geographically incomplete records or scaling up analyses, our methodology identified critical differences in parameters estimated, predictors selected, and inferences. We posit that the differences were attributable to improved data resolution, resulting in greater power and less bias. Importantly, without this methodology, we would have inaccurately identified predictors of risk for asthma ED visits, particularly in rural areas.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our approach innovatively addressed several issues in ecologic health studies, including missing small-area geographic information, multiple correlated neighborhood covariates, and multiscale unmeasured confounding factors. Our methodology could be widely applied to other small-area studies, useful to a range of researchers throughout the world.},

	abstract = {Interviewers play a crucial role in gaining cooperation from a sample unit. This paper aims to identify the interviewer characteristics that influence survey cooperation. Of principal interest to survey practitioners are interviewer attributes associated with higher cooperation rates, particularly among sample members whose characteristics are traditionally associated with a lower probability of response. Our data source is unusually rich, in that it contains extensive information on interviewers, including their attitudes and behaviors, which are linked to detailed information on both responding and nonresponding sample units. An important value of the data is that they permit examining a host of as yet unanswered questions about whether some interviewer attributes stimulate cooperation among some respondents but not others. In short, we investigate whether some sample units react favorably to certain interviewer characteristics. A multilevel cross-classified logistic model with random interviewer effects is used to account for clustering of households within interviewers, due to unmeasured interviewer attributes, and for the cross-classification of interviewers within areas. The model allows for statistical interactions between interviewer and household characteristics.We find that interviewer confidence and attitudes toward persuading reluctant respondents play an important role in explaining between-interviewer variation in refusal rates. We also find evidence of interaction effects between the interviewer and householder, for example with respect to gender and educational level, supporting the notion of similarity between interviewers and respondents generating higher cooperation. The results are discussed with respect to potential implications for survey practice and design.},

It is unclear how much interpenetration is needed for a cross-classified multilevel model to work well and to estimate the two higher-level effects reliably. The paper investigates this question and the properties of cross-classified multilevel logistic models under various survey conditions. The effects of different membership allocation schemes, total sample sizes, group sizes, number of groups, overall rates of response and the variance partitioning coefficient on the properties of the estimators and the power of the Wald test are considered. The work is motivated by an application to separate area and interviewer effects on survey non-response which are often confounded. The results indicate that limited interviewer dispersion (around three areas per interviewer) provides sufficient interpenetration for good estimator properties. Further dispersion yields only very small or negligible gains in the properties. Interviewer dispersion also acts as a moderating factor on the effect of the other simulation factors (sample size, the ratio of interviewers to areas, the overall probability and the variance values) on the properties of the estimators and test statistics. The results also indicate that a higher number of interviewers for a set number of areas and a set total sample size improves these properties.},

This paper defines interviewer effects, argues for the importance of measuring and controlling for interviewer effects in health surveys, provides advice about how to interpret research on interviewer effects and summarizes research to date on race, ethnicity and gender effects. Interviewer effects appear to be most likely to occur when survey items query attitudes about sociodemographic characteristics or respondents’ engagement in sensitive behaviors such as substance use. However, there is surprisingly little evidence to indicate whether sociodemographic interviewer–respondent matching improves survey response rates or data validity, and the use of a matched design introduces possible measurement bias across studies. Additional research is needed to elucidate many issues, including the influence of interviewers’ sociodemographic characteristics on health-related topics, the role of within-group interviewer variability on survey data and the simultaneous impact of multiple interviewer characteristics. The findings of such research would provide much-needed guidance to public health professionals on whether or not to match interviewers and respondents on key sociodemographic characteristics.},

This thesis aims to reveal profiles of data collection staff candidates involved 
in 2013 Turkey Demographic and Health Survey (TDHS-2013) recruitment process. 
This process consisted of different stages, in which the candidates filled in various 
forms. In order to reach the aim of this study, a special data set named “TDHS-2013 
Data Collection Staff data” (hereafter, “staff data set”) was constructed using these 
forms. Descriptive analyses are carried out using nationally representative household 
and women data sets from the TDHS-2013 along with the staff data set. Moreover, pre 
and post processes of the fieldwork are compared by means of certain information 
obtained from recruitment forms. Furthermore, effects of interviewer characteristics 
on both number of completed interviews and interviewer performance are considered. 
Additionally, results of interviews, response rates and completion rates, along with 
sample provinces and assignments of the staff, are evaluated on the basis of data 
collection staff for household interviews and women interviews. 
Results indicate that information on the candidates should be gathered fully 
and kept updated to carry out further analyses in detail. The constructed staff data set 
let us examine the profiles of all applicants for the TDHS-2013 fieldwork, and evaluate 
the relation between interviewer characteristics and their performances. However, the 
constructed staff data set with the available information of interviewers was not 
suitable to make assessments regarding the attitudes, behaviors, and expectations of 
interviewers. Additionally, calculated calendar ratios on displacement of child birth 
dates imply that there is a potential interview bias on child birth date information. We 
expect this study will be a starting point for further studies analyzing interviewer 
profile, and investigating for a relation between data collection staff and survey 
estimates.},

However, we know little about how interviewers might affect responses to survey questions on abortion. The aim of this study is to assess how interviewers affect the probability of women reporting abortions in nationally representative household surveys: Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). We use cross-classified random intercepts at the level of the interviewer and the sampling cluster in a Bayesian framework to analyze the impact of interviewers on the probability of reporting abortions in 22 DHS conducted worldwide. Household surveys are the only available data we can use to study the determinants and pathways of abortion in detail and in a representative manner. Our analyses are motivated by improving our understanding of the reliability of these data. Results show an interviewer effect accounting for between 0.2\% and 50\% of the variance in the odds of a woman reporting ever having had an abortion, after women's demographic characteristics are controlled for. In contrast, sampling cluster effects are much lower in magnitude. Our findings suggest the need for additional effort in assessing the causes of abortion underreporting in household surveys, including interviewers' skills and characteristics. This study also has important implications for improving the collection of other sensitive demographic data (e.g., gender-based violence and sexual health). Data quality of responses to sensitive questions could be improved with more attention to interviewers—their recruitment, training, and characteristics. Future analyses will need to account for the role of interviewer to more fully understand possible data biases.},

	abstract = {Among the poor in developing countries, up to 20\% of an infant's life experience may include diarrhea. This problem is spatially related to the lack of potable water at different sites. This project used risk analysis (RA) methods and geographic information system (GIS) technologies to evaluate the health impact of water source. Maps of Imo State, Nigeria were converted into digital form using ARC/INFO GIS software, and the resulting coverages included geology, hydrology, towns, and villages. A total of 11,537 diarrheal cases were reported. Thirty-nine water sources were evaluated. A computer modeling approach called probabilistic layer analysis (PLA) spatially displayed the water source at layers of geology, hydrology, population, environmental pollution, and electricity according to a color-coded five-point ranking. The water sources were categorized into A, B, and C based on the cumulative scores {\textless} 10 for A, 10-19 for B, and {\textgreater} 19 for C. T-test showed revealed significant differences in diarrheal disease incidence between categories A, B, and C with mean +/- SEM values of 1.612 +/- 0.325, 6.257 +/- 0.408, and 15.608 +/- 2.151, respectively. The differences were significant between categories A and B (P = 0.0000022), A and C (P = 0.0000188), and B and C (P = 0.0011348). The PLA enabled estimation of the probability of the risk of diarrheal diseases occurring at each layer and solutions to eliminate these risks.},

Existing work considers the planning problem as either selecting new sites or adjusting facility capacities, separately. This paper develops a two-step hybrid approach to the problem by optimizing both locations and capacities of facilities towards equal accessibility. A genetic algorithm is first employed to find the best locations to site new facilities, and then a quadratic programming method is used to determine the best capacity of each facility within a pre-defined range. The sequence is consistent with many decision-making practices. Results of a series of experiments demonstrate that location optimization reduces inequality in accessibility more significantly than capacity optimization. The two-step optimization method can be applied for sequential allocation decision-makings towards maximum equal accessibility.},

The floating catchment area (FCA) method defines the service area of physicians by a threshold travel time while accounting for the availability of physicians by their surrounded demands. The gravity-based method considers a nearby physician more accessible than a remote one and discounts a physician's availability by a gravity-based potential. The former is a special case of the latter. Based on the 2000 Census and primary care physician data, this research assesses the variation of spatial accessibility to primary care in the Chicago region, and analyzes the sensitivity of results by experimenting with ranges of threshold travel times in the FCA method and travel friction coefficients in the gravity model. The methods may be used to help the US Department of Health and Human Services and state health departments improve designation of Health Professional Shortage Areas.},

	abstract = {Objectives Malaria risk maps have re-emerged as an important tool for appropriately targeting the limited resources available for malaria control. In Sub-Saharan Africa empirically derived maps using standardized criteria are few and this paper considers the development of a model of malaria risk for East Africa. Methods Statistical techniques were applied to high spatial resolution remotely sensed, human settlement and land-use data to predict the intensity of malaria transmission as defined according to the childhood parasite ratio (PR) in East Africa. Discriminant analysis was used to train environmental and human settlement predictor variables to distinguish between four classes of PR risk shown to relate to disease outcomes in the region. Results Independent empirical estimates of the PR were identified from Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda (n = 330). Surrogate markers of climate recorded on-board earth orbiting satellites, population settlement, elevation and water bodies all contributed significantly to the predictive models of malaria transmission intensity in the sub-region. The accuracy of the model was increased by stratifying East Africa into two ecological zones. In addition, the inclusion of urbanization as a predictor of malaria prevalence, whilst reducing formal accuracy statistics, nevertheless improved the consistency of the predictive map with expert opinion malaria maps. The overall accuracy achieved with ecological zone and urban stratification was 62\% with surrogates of precipitation and temperature being among the most discriminating predictors of the PR. Conclusions It is possible to achieve a high degree of predictive accuracy for Plasmodium falciparum parasite prevalence in East Africa using high-spatial resolution environmental data. However, discrepancies were evident from mapped outputs from the models which were largely due to poor coverage of malaria training data and the comparable spatial resolution of predictor data. These deficiencies will only be addressed by more random, intensive small areas studies of empirical estimates of PR.},

In this paper, the Angolan MIS data were analyzed to produce the first smooth map of parasitaemia prevalence based on contemporary nationwide empirical data in the country. Bayesian geostatistical models were fitted to assess the effect of interventions after adjusting for environmental, climatic and socio-economic factors. Non-linear relationships between parasitaemia risk and environmental predictors were modeled by categorizing the covariates and by employing two non-parametric approaches, the B-splines and the P-splines. The results of the model validation showed that the categorical model was able to better capture the relationship between parasitaemia prevalence and the environmental factors. Model fit and prediction were handled within a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. Combining estimates of parasitaemia prevalence with the number of children under we obtained estimates of the number of infected children in the country. The population-adjusted prevalence ranges from in Namibe province to in Malanje province. The odds of parasitaemia in children living in a household with at least ITNs per person was by 41\% lower (CI: 14\%, 60\%) than in those with fewer ITNs. The estimates of the number of parasitaemic children produced in this paper are important for planning and implementing malaria control interventions and for monitoring the impact of prevention and control activities.},

	abstract = {Background Malaria burden in Uganda has declined disproportionately among regions despite overall high intervention coverage across all regions. The Uganda Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) 2014–15 was the second nationally representative survey conducted to provide estimates of malaria prevalence among children less than 5 years, and to track the progress of control interventions in the country. In this present study, 2014–15 MIS data were analysed to assess intervention effects on malaria prevalence in Uganda among children less than 5 years, assess intervention effects at regional level, and estimate geographical distribution of malaria prevalence in the country. Methods Bayesian geostatistical models with spatially varying coefficients were used to determine the effect of interventions on malaria prevalence at national and regional levels. Spike-and-slab variable selection was used to identify the most important predictors and forms. Bayesian kriging was used to predict malaria prevalence at unsampled locations. Results Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) and Insecticide Treated Nets (ITN) ownership had a significant but varying protective effect on malaria prevalence. However, no effect was observed for Artemisinin Combination-based Therapies (ACTs). Environmental factors, namely, land cover, rainfall, day and night land surface temperature, and area type were significantly associated with malaria prevalence. Malaria prevalence was higher in rural areas, increased with the child’s age, and decreased with higher household socioeconomic status and higher level of mother’s education. The highest prevalence of malaria in children less than 5 years was predicted for regions of East Central, North East and West Nile, whereas the lowest was predicted in Kampala and South Western regions, and in the mountainous areas in Mid-Western and Mid-Eastern regions. Conclusions IRS and ITN ownership are important interventions against malaria prevalence in children less than 5 years in Uganda. The varying effects of the interventions calls for selective implementation of control tools suitable to regional ecological settings. To further reduce malaria burden and sustain malaria control in Uganda, current tools should be supplemented by health system strengthening, and socio-economic development.},
